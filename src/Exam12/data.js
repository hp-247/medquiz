      "A 2-month-old male infant presents with a small pit at the anterior border of his left sternocleidomastoid muscle, with mucus dripping intermittently from the opening. The pit extended to the tonsillar fossa as a branchial fistula. Which of the following embryologic structure(s) is (are) involved in this anomaly?",

      "Second pharyngeal arch",
      "Second pharyngeal pouch and groove",
      "Third pharyngeal pouch",
      "Thyroglossal duct",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Second pharyngeal pouch and cervical sinus",
    explanation:
      "The child in this case suffers from a fistula that indicates an open malformation. This implies that the defect must be due to failure of closure for both an internal and an external structure. This excludes the second pharyngeal arch and third pharyngeal pouch from being the answers alone. A branchial fistula results from failure of closure of both the second pharyngeal pouch and the cervical sinus, the cervical sinus being the consolidation of the second through fourth pharyngeal clefts, all being external structures. The thyroglossal duct extends from the thyroid to the tongue and failure of its closure would not result in an external defect. The second pharyngeal groove merges with the third and fourth pharyngeal grooves to form the cervical sinus. Failure of closure of the second groove alone would not present with an open fistula.",

      "The largest part of the palate is formed by the secondary palate, which is embryologically derived from the lateral palatine processes. The median palatine process gives rise to the smaller primary palate, located anteriorly. The intermaxillary segment gives rise to the middle upper lip, premaxillary part of the maxilla, and the primary palate. The median nasal prominences merge with each other and the maxillary prominences to give rise to the intermaxillary segment.

    correctAnswer: "Failure of the retinal/choroid fissure to close",
    explanation:
      "A coloboma of the iris is caused by failure of the retinal fissure to close during the sixth week. Abnormal neural crest formation would lead to abnormal development of choroid, sclera, and cornea because these are derived from neural crest cells. Abnormal interaction between the optic vesicle and ectoderm would lead to abnormal development of the entire eye because a lens placode may fail to develop or develop abnormally. The iris would not be affected by abnormal development of the posterior chamber. Weak adhesion between the layers of the optic vesicle leads to congenital retinal detachment.",

      "Thyroglossal duct cysts occur due to retention of a remnant of the thyroglossal duct along the path followed by the descending thyroid gland during development. The path begins at the foramen cecum of the tongue and descends in the midline to the final position of the thyroid. The sixth pharyngeal arch provides origin to muscles and cartilage of the neck and would produce a midline mass connected to the tongue.

Defects located between the lateral nasal prominences and the maxillary processes would affect the development of the nasolacrimal duct. Failure of fusion of the medial nasal prominences would produce a median cleft lip, a rare congenital anomaly.

    correctAnswer: "Obstructive hydrocephalus",
    explanation:
      "Obstructive hydrocephalus, in this case resulting from obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius), refers to a condition in which flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obstructed within the ventricular system. This leads to pressure increasing in the CSF upstream from the obstruction, expanding the lateral and third ventricles. Nonobstructive hydrocephalus is due to either excessive CSF production or ineffective CSF reabsorption. This would lead to enlargement of all ventricular chambers. Anencephaly, also known as meroanencephaly, is a partial absence of the brain and is due to defective closure of the anterior neuropore. Holoprosencephaly is a failure of cleavage of the forebrain and would result in a single fused ventricle.",

    explanation:
      "Both the inferior parathyroid glands and the thymus are derived from the third pharyngeal (brachial) pouch. Therefore, an ectopic thymus is likely to be associated with ectopic parathyroid tissue, indicating abnormal development of the third pharyngeal pouch. The lingual tonsil develops from an aggregation of lymph nodules on the tongue and is not associated with development of the thymus. The submandibular gland develops from endodermal buds in the floor of the stomodeum and is not associated with development of the thymus. The thyroid gland arises from an outpocketing of the floor of the primitive oral cavity, descending along the route of the thyroglossal duct, and it is not associated with development of the thymus.

      "A normal APGAR score indicates that the child appeared normal and healthy at birth, based on skin color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone, and breathing (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration). An atretic external acoustic canal occurs due to failure of the meatal plug to canalize, an event that normally occurs in late fetal life. Failure of the otic pit to form results in an absent otic vesicle and absence of the membranous labyrinth. The first pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the tympanic membrane and cavity, and abnormal development would not affect the external acoustic meatus.

The cervical rib is usually located on the C7 vertebra and can impinge on the brachial plexus, resulting in loss of some feeling to the upper limb. There would be no impingement on the phrenic nerve because it leaves C3 to C5 directly parallel with the vertebral column. The syndrome does not include reduction of blood flow to the thoracic wall because of extensive anastomoses between the vessels that supply blood to the anterior thoracic wall.

The usual symptoms for SCG injury, commonly known as Horner’s syndrome, are miosis, ptosis, and anhydrosis in the head and neck region. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves usually run alongside the arteries leading into the head and neck region. The submandibular ganglion does not carry sympathetic nerves to areas of the head and neck. The trigeminal ganglion includes only cell bodies from afferent sensory nerves from the head. The geniculate ganglion includes cell bodies for taste sensation from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, carried by the facial nerve; it also transmits parasympathetic innervation to many sections of the head and face.

      "The chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve in the infratemporal fossa, and a lesion to the lingual nerve before it joins the chorda tympani would account for the loss of general sensation, with no loss to the special sense of taste and saliva production. If the chorda tympani were injured, the patient would present with a loss of taste (from the anterior two thirds of tongue) and a decrease in saliva production because the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands would be denervated. The inferior alveolar nerve provides sensory innervation to the mandibular teeth, but no such loss is present. The lesser petrosal nerve innervates postganglionic neurons supplying the parotid gland, but no loss of salivation is present. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides taste innervation to the posterior third of the tongue and sensation related to the gag reflex, but there is no deficit present in this patient.",

      "A 70-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with chronic headache and enlarged lymph nodes. A CT scan shows a tumor at the jugular foramen. Which of the following would be the most likely neurologic deficit?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Loss of tongue movements",
      "Loss of facial expression",
      "Loss of sensation from the face and the scalp",
      "Loss of hearing",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Loss of gag reflex",
    explanation:
      "The jugular foramen is the route of exit for three nerves (glossopharyngeal [CN IX], vagus [CN X], and spinal accessory [CN XI], nerves) and one vein (internal jugular vein) from the cranial cavity. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides the sensory input for the gag reflex, whereas the vagus nerve provides the motor output. Nerve compression within this foramen would lead to a loss of both systems and thus no gag reflex. Tongue movements are almost entirely supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), which exits the skull through the hypoglossal canal. The facial nerve (CN VII) innervates the muscles of the face and would not be affected by this injury. Loss of sensation from the face and scalp would be present only if there was involvement of the trigeminal nerve. Loss of hearing would be present with any compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). The vestibulocochlear nerve was formally called the auditory nerve but vestibulocochlear clearly refers to its dual function and hearing.",

    explanation:
      "The middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery and courses between the dura mater and skull close to the area of the pterion. Any fracture or impact trauma to this location typically results in a laceration of the middle meningeal artery resulting in an epidural hematoma. The external carotid artery ends behind the mandible by dividing into the maxillary and the superficial temporal arteries, and neither of these arteries directly affects the meninges of the brain. The deep temporal arteries do not penetrate the bony skull and thus would not contribute to an epidural hematoma (GAS Fig. 8-33).",

Which of the following structures was most likely affected by the tumor to result in these symptoms?",

      "Optic nerve",
      "Facial nerve",
      "Ciliary ganglion",
      "Superior cervical ganglion",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Oculomotor nerve",
    explanation:
      "An injury to the oculomotor nerve (CN III) would cause the eye to point downward and laterally due to the unopposed contractions of the muscles innervated by the trochlear (CN IV) and abducens (CN VI) nerves (superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles, respectively). The oculomotor nerve also provides innervation to the levator palpebrae superioris; thus, any injury will cause complete ptosis or inability to raise the eyelid. The constriction of the pupil is provided by parasympathetic nerves via the oculomotor nerve. The optic nerve is responsible only for the sensory aspect of light via the retina in the eye. The facial nerve innervates the facial muscles, including the orbicularis oculi, which closes the eylid for the blink reflex. The ciliary ganglion could be damaged in this patient, but the loss of parasympathetic supply will not adequately explain the ptosis of the eyelid. The superior cervical ganglion provides sympathetic innervation to the head and neck including the smooth muscle in the upper lid (superior tarsal muscle of Müller), but no loss of sympathetics is evident in this patient.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "The aponeurosis and the periosteum",
    explanation:
      "The scalp is divided into five layers: skin, dense connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, and periosteum. A handy mnemonic is SCALP (skin, connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, and periosteum). Typically, infections will be located in the loose connective tissue because of the ease with which infectious agents spread via the many veins located in this region. This area is usually referred to as the “danger zone” of the scalp mainly because scalp infections here can be transmitted into the skull via emissary veins, then via diploic veins of the bone to the cranial cavity. The periosteum and bone are tightly bound together; thus, it is not likely to find infections between these layers. The areas between the dense connective tissue and aponeurosis and between the connective tissue and the skin layers do not include connecting veins but mainly superficial veins of the head. The skin provides a very strong barrier against infections; the epidermis and dermis layers are rarely seen separated, and thus the likelihood of an infection between these areas would be rare.",

    correctAnswer: "Left vagus",
    explanation:
      "An injury to the left vagus nerve (CN X) would cause the uvula to become deviated to the right. This is because the vagus nerve innervates the musculus uvulae muscle that makes up the core of the uvula. If only one side is effectively innervated, contraction of the active muscle will deviate the uvula to the contralateral side of the injury (ipsilateral side of the uninjured vagus nerve). In addition, the intact levator veli palatini will pull the uvula to the intact side. The right and left hypoglossal nerves innervate the tongue muscles and would not affect the uvula. The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the oropharynx and nasopharynx, but not motor innervation to these areas.",

The thyroid gland and the recurrent laryngeal nerve are in close proximity and thus the nerve is the most likely to be injured with a thyroidectomy. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result in speech defects, including hoarseness. The superior laryngeal nerve has two branches: the internal laryngeal nerve innervates the mucous membranes of the larynx above the vocal folds, and the external laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal folds.

      "The superior cervical ganglion provides sympathetic innervation to the face and neck regions. Sympathetics travel along the branches of the internal carotid artery, and one result of stimulation of these nerves is to dilate the pupil during a sympathetic response (“flight or fight”). The oculomotor nerve would not affect the dilation of the pupil; rather, its stimulation results in the constriction (parasympathetic nerves). The nervus intermedius is the parasympathetic component to the facial nerve and affects only lacrimation of the eye. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus is the location of the cell bodies of the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that are carried by the oculomotor nerve (not sympathetics).

      "Ophthalmic nerve",
      "Maxillary nerve",
      "Trochlear nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Abducens nerve",
    explanation:
      "The abducens nerve would be affected first due to aneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid artery (ICA) because the nerve runs in closest proximity to the artery within the cavernous sinus. The other nerves running in the wall of the cavernous sinus are the oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, and both the maxillary and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve. Each of these nerves, however, courses along, or within, the lateral walls of the cavernous sinus and may not be immediately affected by an aneurysm of the ICA (GAS Fig. 8-45).",

      "Mental",
      "Inferior alveolar",

    correctAnswer: "Lingual",
    explanation:
      "The lingual nerve is the most likely nerve damaged because there is loss both of taste and general sensory supply to the anterior two thirds of the tongue, which is innervated by the lingual nerve, which at this point has been joined by the chorda tympani. The chorda tympani would be a likely choice; however, it carries only taste and does not mediate other general sensation to the tongue. The auriculotemporal nerve is a posterior branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and innervates skin near the ear and temporal region. The mental nerve is the terminal branch of the inferior alveolar nerve and innervates the skin of the chin.",

      "The auriculotemporal nerve is a posterior branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It encircles the middle meningeal artery and courses medially to the TMJ and then ascends up near skin of the external auditory canal, pain from the joint can be referred to the ear as in this case. The facial nerve courses over the ascending ramus of the man- dible, passing superficial to the masseter muscle and below the TMJ through the parotid gland, and would not be involved in this problem. The lesser petrosal nerve courses through the middle cranial fossa and exits through the foramen ovale, where it joins the otic ganglion. The vestibulocochlear nerve exits the cranial cavity through the internal acoustic meatus and innervates structures in the inner ear.

    correctAnswer: "Posterior cricoarytenoids",
    explanation:
      "The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles lie on the superoposterior aspect of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage. When these muscles contract, they cause lateral rotation (abduction) of the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages, thereby opening the space between the vocal folds, the rima glottidis. The lateral cricoarytenoid is involved with adducting the aryte- noid cartilage and closing the rima glottidis. The thy- roarytenoid muscles lie alongside either vocal ligament and are also involved in adducting the vocal folds. The transverse arytenoid muscle connects both aryte- noid cartilages and also aids in closing the rima glot- tidis. Finally, the cricothyroid muscle is located on the anterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage and aids in elongation and tensing of the vocal folds, thus raising the pitch of the voice.",

Upon surgical divi- sion of the nerve, the patient will lose the ability to raise the ipsilateral shoulder and will demonstrate weakness in turning the head to the opposite side. The trapezius will also lose tone and the shoulder will droop. The ansa cervicalis innervates strap muscles of the neck and, if cut, would not produce drooping of the shoulder. The facial nerve does not pass through any of the triangles of the neck; however, if it were divided, paralysis would result in the muscles of facial expression.

      "The most likely structures one would encounter while performing a midline incision below the isthmus of the thyroid gland would be the inferior thyroid vein and the thyroidea ima artery. The inferior thyroid vein drains typically to the left brachiocephalic vein, which crosses superficially, just inferior to the isthmus. The thyroidea ima artery arises from the aortic arch, vertebral artery, or other source but is not a constant structure. The middle thyroid veins drain the thyroid gland to the internal jugular vein and are superior to the incision site.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the majority of the vocal muscles that open and close the rima glottidis, in addition to providing sensory supply to the larynx below the vocal folds. Even relatively mild trauma to the nerve can result in hoarseness. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is not in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery and pierces the thyrohyoid membrane to enter the pharynx.

The ansa cervicalis innervates the strap muscles of the neck, with the exception of the thyrohyoid muscle. The cervical sympathetic trunk does not enter into the jugular foramen; it runs behind the carotid sheath, parallel with the internal carotid artery; its carotid branch accompanies the artery into the carotid canal and carries sympathetic fibers to deep areas of the head.

Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve would result in loss of taste in the posterior third of the tongue and a loss of soft palate sensation and gag reflex on the affected side. The inferior alveolar nerve supplies the tissues of the chin and lower teeth. The lingual nerve conveys parasympathetic preganglionic fibers to the submandibular ganglion and general sensation and taste fibers for the anterior two thirds of the tongue.

Damage to this nerve would additionally result in painful movements of the TMJ because this joint receives innervation from the same nerve. Taste in the anterior two thirds of the tongue is supplied by the facial nerve and would be unaf- fected in this injury. (The chorda tympani could be injured, but its superior location on the medial side would make this unlikely.) The sensory innervation of the nasal cavity is supplied by the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and would be unaffected by injury to the tympanic membrane.

    correctAnswer: "Stapedius",
    explanation:
      "Both the stapedius and tensor tympani nor- mally function to dampen movements of the middle ear ossicles, thereby muting sound and preventing hyperacusis. A stapedius would be the source of hyperacusis in this problem because it receives its innervation from the facial nerve. The tensor tympani receives motor innervation from the mandibular divi- sion of the trigeminal nerve. The posterior belly of the digastric and the stylohyoid receive innervation from the facial nerve, but their paralysis would not cause hyperacusis. Damaged innervation of the cricothy- roid, which is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, would not result in hyperacusis.",

    correctAnswer:
      "Dryness of the right cornea due to lack of lacrimal gland secretion",
    explanation:
      "The greater petrosal nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that are involved in the innervation of the lacrimal gland, as well as the mucosal glands of the nose, palate, and pharynx. As a result, an injury to the right greater petrosal nerve would be expected to result in decreased lacrimal secretions for the right eye. The sublingual and submandibular glands receive their parasympathetic fibers from the facial nerve via the chorda tympani and the lingual nerve. They would be unaffected by this lesion. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic secretory innervation from the glossopharyngeal nerve via the lesser petrosal and auriculotemporal nerves and would be unaffected.

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Diminished saliva production by the parotid gland",
    explanation:
      "Parasympathetic innervation of the parotid gland is provided by axons carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve that emerge from the tympanic plexus of the middle ear as the lesser petrosal nerve. These preganglionic parasympathetic fibers terminate at synapses in the otic ganglion, which supplies the secretory parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Glandular secretions of the nasal cavity, soft palate, and lacrimal gland all receive parasympathetic innervation from the fibers of the greater petrosal nerve and would remain intact following a tympanic plexus lesion. Axons for secretory innervation to the sublingual and submandibular glands are carried by the facial nerve, then course through the chorda tympani, before synapsing in the submandibular gan- glion, with postganglionic fibers eventually reaching the glands via the lingual nerve (GAS Figs. 8-116 and 8-121).",

The lingual nerve provides taste and sensation to the anterior two thirds of the tongue and carries general sensory fibers, taste fibers, and parasympathetic fibers. It does not provide sensory innervation to the teeth. The buccal nerve provides sensory innervation to the inner surface of the cheek. The mental nerve is the distal continuation of the inferior alveolar nerve as it exits the mental foramen of the mandible and does not affect the teeth.

    incorrectAnswers: ["Optic", "Oculomotor", "Abducens", "Frontal"],
    correctAnswer: "Trochlear",
    explanation:
      "The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, which acts to move the pupil down- ward and laterally. It is the only muscle that can depress the pupil when the eye is adducted. When an individual walks down stairs, this eye motion is initi- ated, and diplopia results if it is not functioning properly. The optic nerve provides vision, and a lesion of this nerve would not result in diplopia when an affected individual walks down the stairs, but rather diminished vision or blindness. The oculomotor nerve supplies the superior, inferior, and medial rectus as well as the inferior oblique. Overall, innervation from the oculomotor nerve results in upward and inward movements of the eye, and a lesion of this nerve would not induce diplopia in an individual walking down stairs. The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye, and damage would not induce the diplopia presented in this problem. The frontal nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and pro- vides sensory innervation to the forehead.",

      "The superior oblique muscle turns the pupil downward from the adducted position. Inability to perform this motion, in conjunction with diplopia when walking down stairs, indicates damage to the trochlear nerve. The abducens innervates the lateral rectus, resulting in abduction of the eye. The oculo- motor nerve supplies the superior, inferior, and medial rectus as well as the inferior oblique muscles. Overall, innervation from the oculomotor nerve results in upward and downward movements of the eye. Damage to this nerve would not induce diplopia when an affected individual walks down stairs. In addition, inability to gaze downward in the adducted position does not indicate oculomotor nerve damage. In this position the oculomotor nerve would be responsible for upward movement.

    correctAnswer: "Ptosis and miosis",
    explanation:
      "Ptosis and miosis occur in response to block- ing of sympathetic innervation. Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) results from lack of innervation of the superior tarsal muscle (of Müller), and miosis (pupil- lary constriction) results from unopposed parasympa- thetic innervation of the pupil. A dilated pupil would not occur because this requires the action of the sympathetically innervated dilator pupillae. Dry eye would occur due to lacrimal gland insufficiency, but because this is mediated by parasympathetic fibers, it would remain unaffected in this case. The same holds true for the parasympathetically mediated accommo- dation pathway. Depth perception involves the visual pathway and is not mediated by the sympathetic system.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Inward", "Downward", "Down and out", "Down and in"],
    correctAnswer: "Outward",
    explanation:
      "The right abducens nerve innervates the right lateral rectus, which mediates outward movement (abduction) of the right eye. Inward movement is accomplished by the medial rectus, supplied by the oculomotor nerve. Downward movement in the midline is accomplished by joint activation of the superior oblique and inferior rectus muscle. Down- ward movement of the pupil from the adducted posi- tion is a function of the superior oblique alone, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve. Down and out motion is mediated by the combined actions of the lateral rectus and inferior rectus muscles, which are innervated by the abducens and oculomotor nerves. Downward movement of the pupil from a forward gaze is a result of combined actions of inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles, supplied by oculomo- tor and trochlear nerves, respectively.",

      "Horner’s syndrome involves interruption of sympathetic supply to the face. This results in ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhydrosis (lack of sweating) of the face. The eye is lubricated by the lacrimal gland, which secretes in response to parasympathetic stimulation, and would be unaffected. Exophthalmos (protrusion of the globe) is frequently caused by hyperthyroidism and is not present in Horner’s syndrome.

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Superior tarsal (of Müller)",
    explanation:
      "The superior tarsal muscle (of Müller), inner- vated by sympathetics, is smooth muscle that assists in elevating the eyelids and maintaining this position. Loss of sympathetic innervation will result in partial ptosis of the eyelid. The superior oblique, innervated by the trochlear nerve, moves the pupil downward from the adducted position (for example, as when the right eye gazes down toward the left foot). To test the trochlear nerve, ask the patient to look with each eye toward the tip of the nose. The orbicularis oculi, innervated by the facial nerve, is responsible for closure of the eye. The palpebral part closes the eyelids ordinarily; the lacrimal part contracts when the eye is closed more forcibly, resulting in increased tear movement across the globe (perhaps to flow down the cheeks). Damage to the levator palpebrae superioris, innervated by the oculomotor nerve, would result in complete, rather than partial, ptosis.",

      "Middle meningeal artery",
      "Parietal emissary vein",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Ophthalmic vein",
    explanation:
      "Cavernous sinus thrombosis can often result from squeezing pimples or other infectious processes located around the danger area of the face, which includes the area of the face directly surrounding the nose. This physical pressure has the potential to move infectious agents from the pimple into the ophthalmic vein, which then carries it to the cavernous sinus. The pterygoid venous plexus and ophthalmic vein both communicate with the cavernous sinus and therefore offer a route of travel for the spread of infection, but the path provided by the superior ophthalmic vein is a more direct route. Additionally, the superior oph- thalmic vein receives blood supply from the supraor- bital, supratrochlear, and angular veins that supply the area around the nose and lower forehead. (Venous blood in the head can flow in either direction because these veins do not possess valves.) The emissary veins communicate between the venous sinuses and the veins of the scalp and would therefore not be involved in the spread of infection between the nose and cavernous sinus. The middle meningeal artery courses between the dura and periosteum, whereas the carotid artery, specifically the ICA, traverses through the cavernous sinus and provides origin to the ophthalmic artery. As with the middle meningeal artery, the carotid artery would not offer a route of communication between the area of infection and the cavernous sinus (GAS Fig. 8-65).",

Nerves located in close proximity would likely be affected by hemorrhage of this artery. The optic, oculomotor, and trochlear nerves are all associated with the midbrain region and would likely not suffer any damage with a possible hemorrhage. The trigeminal nerve is situated in the pons and is thus located too far rostrally to be affected.

      "The anterior inferior quadrant of the eardrum is the only portion of the tympanic membrane that would allow for an incision with minimal or no damage to adjacent important structures. Incision in the anterior and posterior superior quadrants of the eardrum would likely damage the malleus, which is situated immediately superior and medially to the tympanic membrane. The umbo is situated in close proximity to the handle of the malleus and might be damaged during incision. A vertical incision through the eardrum would almost certainly damage the malleus of the middle ear. Damage to the malleus from surgical incision would interfere with the audi- tory conduction through the middle ear cavity, and this should be avoided to prevent conductive hearing loss.",

      "The hypoglossal nerve innervates the muscles of the tongue and is therefore directly involved in alteration of shape and movement of the tongue. A lesion in this nerve would cause deviation of the tongue toward the injured side, which could be observed upon protrusion of the tongue. The genioglossus is the major muscle involved in protrusion of the tongue. The genioglossus muscles arise from the inside of the mandible and pass posteriorly to insert into the deep aspect of the tongue. When the genioglossus muscles contract, they pull the tongue forward, and out of the mouth, in protrusion. If one genioglossus is paralyzed, it acts like a brake on one side of the tongue when the tongue is pulled forward, causing the tip of the tongue to point to the nonmoving side. The styloglossus muscle is responsible for retraction and elevation of the tongue.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Anterior chamber", "Vitreous", "Pupil", "Lacrimal sac"],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior chamber",
    explanation:
      "The posterior chamber receives ciliary body secretions first. The ciliary body produces aqueous humor and is located in the posterior chamber. Increased production of fluid from this site would cause an increase in intraocular pressure if drainage is inadequate. The iridoscleral angle of the anterior chamber is the location of drainage of the aqueous humor; therefore, a blockage of drainage in this location can cause increased intraocular pressure. The pupil is the connection between the anterior and posterior chamber; a collection of fluid does not occur here, for this is simply an aperture to allow light onto the retina. The vitreous body is not directly connected to the production of aqueous humor. The lacrimal sac is the upper dilated end of the nasolacrimal duct and opens up into the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity.

    explanation:
      "A tumor of the jugular canal would likely affect the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves as they exit the cranium through the jugular foramen. The uvula deviates toward the unaffected side of the pharyngeal muscles because of the pull of the unopposed levator veli palatini. In this case, the uvula deviates to the left, indicating that the left palatal muscles are unaffected whereas the right muscles are not working properly. The pharyngeal wall on the left side is also drawn upward by the nonparalyzed stylopharyngeus, supplied by the left glossopharyngeal nerve. The pharyngeal constrictor muscles, as well as muscles of the palate, are all innervated by the vagus nerve, except for the tensor veli palatini, which is supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. The right mandibular nerve (of the mandibular division of trigeminal nerve) provides sensory innervation to the face and motor supply to the masticatory muscles and does not innervate the muscles of the pharynx.

If the patient is not treated with antibiotics promptly, the pharyngeal and submandibular swelling can lead to asphyxiation. Quinsy, also known as peritonsillar abscess, is a pus-filled inflammation of the tonsils that can occur due to tonsillitis.

The affected person will usually have a speech impediment. Torus palatinus is a benign bony growth on the hard palate; a torus mandibularis is a similar growth on the inside of the mandible. Such growths are usually benign and would not typically cause pain.

      "A 54-year-old man is diagnosed with an aneurysm of the basilar artery close to the cavernous sinus. An anterior approach to the sella turcica through the nasal cavity is performed. Through which of the following routes is the surgeon most likely to gain access to the cranial cavity?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Cribriform plate",
      "Cavernous sinus",
      "Frontal sinus",
      "Maxillary sinus",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sphenoidal sinus",
    explanation:
      "The sphenoidal sinus provides the most direct access to the pituitary gland, which is situated directly above this sinus. Neither the frontal sinus nor maxillary sinus has any direct communication with the interior of the cranial vault and would therefore not allow the surgeon a potential access point to the pituitary gland. The cribriform plate could offer a point of entry into the cranium; entry at that site would lead to damage of the olfactory cells and nerve, but it would also lead to entry into the subarachnoid space, with leakage of CSF and potential meningitis. The cribriform plates are also located too far anteriorly from the pituitary gland. The cavernous sinus is situated within the cranial vault and surrounds the pituitary gland; it is not a site for surgical entrance to the cranial cavity",

      "A 10-year-old girl is admitted to the hospital with tonsillitis. A tonsillectomy is performed and the tonsils are removed. On physical examination 1 week later the patient has absence of the gag reflex on the left when the posterior part of the tongue is depressed. The sensory portion of which of the following nerves was most likely injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Facial", "Mandibular", "Maxillary", "Hypoglossal"],
    correctAnswer: "Glossopharyngeal",
    explanation:
      "The gag reflex is composed of both an afferent and an efferent limb. These reflexes are mediated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, respectively. Together, the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves are responsible for the contraction of the muscles of the pharynx involved in the gag reflex. In this case the glossopharyngeal nerve was injured when the tonsils were excised, resulting in the loss of the sensory side of the reflex. The mandibular and maxillary nerves are part of the trigeminal nerve and are thus largely associated with the sensory supply of the face, sinuses, and oral cavity. The hypoglossal nerve innervates most of the muscles of the tongue. The facial nerve is involved with taste of the anterior two thirds of the tongue; however, it does not mediate the gag reflex",

    explanation:
      "The recurrent laryngeal nerve is often at risk of being damaged during a thyroidectomy. Patients who have a transected or damaged recurrent laryngeal will often present with a characteristic hoarseness following surgery. The posterior cricoarytenoid is supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and would thus be impaired following damage to the nerve. The posterior cricoarytenoid is the only muscle responsible for abduction of the vocal cords, and paralysis of this muscle would result in a permanently adducted position of the involved vocal cord. The other muscles listed are all adductors of the vocal cords, and paralysis of these would not lead to closure of the airway.",

    explanation:
      "The pharyngeal tonsil is situated in a slitlike space, the pharyngeal recess, in the nasopharynx behind the opening of the auditory (eustachian) tube, and a pharyngeal tonsil in this location can lead to blockage of the drainage of the auditory tube. The lingual tonsil is located in the posterior aspect of the tongue, whereas the palatine tonsil is contained within the tonsillar fossa between the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches. An enlargement of the lingual tonsil or the palatine tonsil will not occlude the auditory tube due to their location in the oropharynx. The superior pharyngeal constrictor would not be involved in occlusion of the auditory tube because it is located more posteriorly. The uvula is drawn upward during deglutition and prevents food from entering the nasopharynx; it does not block the auditory tube.",

    correctAnswer: "First",
    explanation:
      "Infection can spread from the nasopharynx to the middle ear by way of the auditory tube, which opens to both spaces. The first pharyngeal pouch is responsible for formation both of the auditory tube and middle ear (tympanic) cavity. The second pharyngeal pouch persists as the tonsillar sinus and tonsillar crypts. The third pharyngeal pouch develops into the inferior parathyroid gland and thymus, whereas the fourth pharyngeal pouch forms the remainder of the parathyroid glands and the ultimobranchial body.

    explanation:
      "The greater palatine nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the hard palate, or the hard part of the roof of the mouth. The lesser palatine nerve supplies the soft palate and palatine tonsil but is not involved in supply to the hard palate. The posterior superior alveolar nerve supplies multiple structures, including posterior portions of the gums, cheeks, and the upper posterior teeth. However, it is not involved in nerve supply to the hard palate. The inferior alveolar nerve has several branches, including the mental nerve, incisive branch, nerve to the mylohyoid, and inferior dental branch.

The external laryngeal nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve are both at risk during thyroidectomy. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would result in paralysis of all the laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid; it would render the patient hoarse, with a loss of sensation below the vocal cords.

When these postganglionic cholinergic axons grow peripherally after parotid surgery, they establish synapses upon the cholinergic sweat glands, which are innervated normally only by sympathetic fibers. As the peripheral nerves make new connections, aberrant connections can be formed between the auriculotemporal nerve and other glands (not usually innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve).

      "A 45-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with a severe headache. The patient is diagnosed with hypertension and arrhythmias. To reduce the patient’s blood pressure, massage is initiated at a pressure point located deep to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. Which of the following structures is targeted by the massage?",

    correctAnswer: "Carotid sinus",
    explanation:
      "The carotid sinus is a baroreceptor that can be targeted for carotid massage to decrease blood pressure. The carotid sinus receptors are sensitive to changes in pressure. For this reason, sustained compression of the carotid sinuses can lead to unconsciousness or death as the heart rate is reflexively reduced. The carotid body is a chemoreceptor, responsive to the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Neither the thyroid gland nor the parathyroid gland has anything to do with acute control of blood pressure due to mechanical stimuli. The inferior cervical ganglion fuses with the first thoracic ganglion to form the stellate ganglion. It gives rise to the inferior cervical cardiac nerve and provides postganglionic sympathetic supply to the upper limb.",

    correctAnswer: "Thyroidea ima artery",
    explanation:
      "The thyroidea ima artery is present in about 10% of people; when present it supplies the thyroid gland and ascends in the front of the trachea; therefore, it would be easily injured in an emergency tracheostomy with a midline incision over the trachea. The inferior thyroid branch of the thyrocervical trunk does not run along the front of the trachea in such a position that a midline incision could damage it. The cricothyroid branch of the superior thyroid artery passes across the cricothyroid ligament, well above the site of incision. Arterial bleeding would not result from damage to either the middle thyroid vein or the jugular venous arch.",

A lumbar puncture does not reveal blood in the CSF. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "The middle meningeal artery was torn, resulting in epidural hematoma",
      "There is a fracture in the pterion with injury to the adjacent vasculature",
      "The injury resulted in the bursting of a preexisting aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery of the cerebral circle",
      "The cavernous sinus has a thrombus",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A cerebral vein is torn",
    explanation:
      "A torn cerebral vein often results in a relatively slow-bleeding subdural hematoma. Such a hematoma can be involved in gradual compression of the brain, resulting in confusion, dizziness, clumsiness, and memory loss. There would be no sign of blood in the CSF because the bleeding is into the subdural space, not the subarachnoid space. This would fit the description of symptoms in this case. Middle meningeal artery rupture results in an epidural hematoma, which is much more acute and often includes a brief period of unconsciousness followed by a lucid interval and can proceed to death if the bleeding is left untreated. Fracture of the pterion also can result in an epidural hematoma because the middle meningeal artery is the adjacent vasculature mentioned. Rupture of the anterior communicating artery would result in a subarachnoid hematoma, and there would be blood in the CSF upon lumbar puncture. In a cavernous sinus thrombosis there would be cranial nerve involvement due to compression of those nerves that run through or near the cavernous sinus, including the oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal (maxillary and mandibular divisions), and abducens nerves.",

    correctAnswer: "Right accessory and right hypoglossal nerves",
    explanation:
      "Paralysis of the right accessory and hypoglossal nerves is present in this patient. Drooping of the right shoulder occurs as a result of paralysis of the trapezius as a result of injury to the right accessory nerve, which supplies that muscle. Loss of the right accessory nerve would also result in weakness in turning the head to the left, a function of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is supplied by this nerve. The tongue deviation to the right is due to the unopposed activity of the left tongue muscles since the right hypoglossal nerve (which innervates the right tongue muscles) is affected.

    explanation:
      "A branch of the facial artery would be of primary concern because its branches supply the oropharynx and it is the primary source of arterial supply to the palatine tonsil. The location of the lingual artery is inferior to the oropharynx and it would be less likely to be injured in the event of a surgical procedure. The superior laryngeal artery is also located lower and would not be subject to injury by surgery in the area of the oropharynx. The ascending pharyngeal artery arises in the carotid triangle from the external carotid artery and gives rise to pharyngeal, palatine, inferior tympanic, and meningeal branches. This vessel is located inferiorly to the site of surgery. Terminal branches of the descending palatine artery could be encountered at the upper pole of the palatine tonsil, but the main stem of the vessel would not be endangered in the surgical treatment here.",

The middle meningeal artery would not be a good answer because its location is near the pterion on the temporal aspect of the skull but its bleeding would be profuse, not slow. The great cerebral vein (of Galen) is located posteriorly in the cranial cavity and is not in the right location for an injury of this type to disrupt it. The straight dural venous sinus is also posterior, receiving the draining of the inferior sagittal sinus and the great vein (of Galen). It drains posteriorly to the confluence of sinuses (eponym: Torcular of Herophilis).

    correctAnswer: "Inferior division of oculomotor, trochlear, abducens",
    explanation:
      "For proper movements of the eye to occur, all the cranial nerves that innervate the extraocular eye muscles are required (oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves). The inferior division of the oculomotor innervates the inferior rectus, the medial rectus, and the inferior oblique. Lateral movement of the eye is initiated by the lateral rectus (abducens nerve), assisted thereafter by the superior oblique (trochlear nerve). The inferior rectus (inferior division of the oculomotor nerve) balances the upward deviation exerted by the superior rectus (superior division of the oculomotor nerve). The medial rectus (superior division of the oculomotor nerve) must relax to facilitate the lateral excursion. Answers A, B, and D all have branches of the trigeminal nerve, which have no role in motor movement of the eye.

The pterion overlies the anterior branch of the middle meningeal vessels, and damage to these vessels would result in an epidural hematoma, with compression of the brain. Leakage of branches of the middle meningeal artery within the temporal bone would cause blood vessels within the bone to leak, without direct connection to the CSF fluid. A tear of the cerebral vein in the superior sagittal sinus would lead to a subdural hematoma, in which the blood collects in the subdural space, without entry to CSF.

The trochlear nerve passes between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery, and therefore a hematoma of the superior cerebellar artery can easily injure the trochlear nerve, which runs alongside the internal carotid artery and then enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The facial and vestibulocochlear nerves both enter the skull via the internal acoustic meatus (or internal auditory meatus) in the temporal bone and do not have an intimate relationship with the superior cerebellar artery.

      "Bleeding into the cerebral ventricular system",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Subdural bleeding",
    explanation:
      ". Subdural bleeding usually results from tears in veins that cross the subdural space, between the dura and the arachnoid. This bleeding may cause a gradual increase in intracranial pressure and may result in leakage of venous blood over the right cerebral hemisphere with a variable rate of progression. A subarachnoid bleed is due to rupture of an artery into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Hydrocephalus may result if the subarachnoid bleeding or subsequent fibrosis creates obstructions to CSF flow through the subarachnoid space or drainage of the CSF. Epidural bleeding results in most cases from tearing of the middle meningeal artery, and this rapidly expanding, space-occupying lesion can cause death within 12 hours. Intracerebral bleeding into the brain parenchyma is focal bleeding from a blood vessel into the brain parenchyma, most likely caused by hypertension and/or atherosclerosis. Typical symptoms include focal neurologic deficits, with abrupt onset of headache, nausea, and impairment of consciousness. Bleeding into the cerebral ventricular system may be due to trauma or hemorrhage of blood from nearby arteries, especially those related to the supply of the choroid plexus",

      "The lateral pterygoid muscle is a muscle of mastication innervated by the lateral pterygoid nerve of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. The lateral pterygoid acts to protrude the mandible and open the jaw. The anterior portion of temporalis is a muscle of mastication innervated by the deep temporal nerves of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve that elevates the mandible when contracted.

    question:
      "A 56-year-old man visits the outpatient clinic with a complaint of severe headaches and ear pain. Radiologic examination reveals a tumor in the middle ear cavity, invading through the bony floor. Which of the following structures will most likely be affected?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "The cochlea and lateral semicircular canal",
      "The internal carotid artery",
      "The sigmoid venous sinus",
      "The aditus ad antrum of the mastoid region and the facial nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "The internal jugular bulb",
    explanation:
      "The sigmoid sinus collects venous blood from the transverse sinuses and empties it into a small cavity known as the jugular bulb, the inferior portion of which is located beneath the bony floor of the middle ear cavity. A paraganglioma is a tumor that may originate from paraganglia cells found in the middle ear and on the jugular bulb. Tumors that originate from the jugular bulb can grow to fill the entire bulb and may effectively block blood returning to the heart from that side of the brain. Blood flow from the brain is gradually diverted toward the opposite sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb, causing the opposite venous system to expand and accommodate increased blood flow. The cochlea and lateral semicircular canals are located in the inner ear and are not directly affected by such a tumor. The internal carotid artery is related to the anterior wall of the middle ear cavity and is not likely to be affected by a tumor penetrating the middle ear. The sigmoid venous sinus collects venous blood beneath the temporal bone and follows a tortuous (S-shaped) course to the jugular foramen where it becomes continuous with the internal jugular vein at the jugular bulb. The aditus ad antrum is the entrance to the mastoid antrum, which is the common cavity in the mastoid bone into which mastoid air cells open. Below the aditus ad antrum is an elevation of bone, the pyramid of the stapes, which is occupied by the stapedius muscle.",

      "The glossopharyngeal nerve has been injured in the pharynx",
      "The superior laryngeal nerve was obviously severed by the bullet",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "The lingual nerve was injured at its origin near the foramen ovale",
    explanation:
      "The lingual nerve supplies sensory innervation to the mucous membrane of the anterior two thirds of the tongue, taste sensation to the anterior part of the tongue, and parasympathetic fibers to the oral salivary glands. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve is responsible for carrying taste fibers from the anterior two thirds of the tongue and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers for the submandibular ganglion. Injury to the lingual nerve at its origin, before it joins with the chorda tympani, will result in loss of general sensation of the tongue, but with preservation of taste and salivary function. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve would result in loss of general sensory and taste fibers from the posterior third of the tongue and parasympathetic supply for the parotid gland. Injury to the superior laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, will result in loss of sensation from the larynx above the vocal folds (GAS Fig. 8-146A).",

To determine the specific type of meningitis (i.e., viral or bacterial), it is necessary to aspirate CSF with a lumbar puncture for laboratory examination. However, before performing a lumbar puncture, it must be established that the CSF pressure is not elevated. What condition in the eye would indicate that CSF pressure is too elevated for a lumbar puncture to be performed?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Separation of the pars optica retinae anterior to the ora serrata",
      "The foveal centralis exhibits hemorrhage from medial retinal branches",
      "Obvious opacity of the lens",
      "Pitting or compression of the optic disc",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Papilledema",
    explanation:
      "Papilledema is optic disc swelling (“edema of the papilla”) that is caused by increased intracranial pressure caused increased CSF pressure. If a lumbar puncture is performed in a patient with elevated CSF pressure and fluid is withdrawn from the lumbar cistern, the brain can become displaced caudally and the brainstem is pushed against the tentorial notch. This is a potentially fatal complication known as brain herniation. Separation of the pars optica retinae anterior to the ora serrata, or retinal detachment, may result in vision loss or blindness. A hemorrhage from medial retinal branches may result in damage to the fovea centralis and can result in macular degeneration. Opacity of the lens (cataracts) will cause gradual yellowing and may reduce the perception of blue colors. Cataracts typically progress slowly to cause vision loss and are potentially blinding if untreated. Compression of the optic disc, resulting from increased intrabulbar pressure, will lead to an excessive accumulation of serous fluid in the tissue space.",

      "Ipsilateral loss of the consensual corneal reflex",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Ipsilateral paralysis of abduction of the pupil",
    explanation:
      "Within the cavernous sinus the abducens nerve is in intimate contact with the internal carotid artery. Therefore, an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery could quickly cause tension or compression on the abducens nerve. This would result in ipsilateral paralysis of abduction of the pupil. Inability to gaze downward and medially would be due to the trochlear nerve, which is not in the cavernous sinus. Complete ptosis would be a result of a complete lesion in the oculomotor nerve, which is not apparent here. Bilateral loss of accommodation and loss of pupillary reflex would be the result of bilateral loss of the oculomotor nerve, which is not likely in this situation. Finally, ipsilateral loss of the consensual corneal reflex is a result of loss of both the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve, supplying the afferent and efferent limbs of the reflex, respectively",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Through the upper eyelid deeply toward the orbital apex and also between the orbital septum and the palpebral musculature laterally",
    explanation:
      "It is necessary to anesthetize the conjunctival covering of the sclera, which is supplied by the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. To do that, the needle should be placed through the upper eyelid deeply toward the orbital apex to infiltrate the nasociliary nerve, and also between the orbital septum and the palpebral musculature laterally to anesthetize lateral sensory supply from the lacrimal nerve and (perhaps) twigs from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. The lacrimal fossa, which is occupied by the lacrimal sac portion of the nasolacrimal duct, is too medial, whereas the supraorbital foramen is above the eye.

An infection or abscess in this space could thus travel toward the posterior mediastinum. The retropharyngeal space is enclosed between the visceral fascia covering the posterior wall of the pharynx and the alar layer of the prevertebral fascia. The alar fascia is formed from bilateral anterior extensions of the prevertebral fascia. Between the alar fascia and the more posterior prevertebral fascia covering the skeletal musculature is the so-called danger space of the neck. This space is continuous superiorly to the base of the skull and continues inferiorly through the posterior mediastinum to the level of the respiratory diaphragm. The alar fascia is continuous with the carotid sheath and provides the posterior boundary for the retropharyngeal space. Attachments of the alar fascia to the retropharyngeal fascia result in separation of the pretracheal space from the retropharyngeal space. The prevertebral fascia invests the vertebral column and the intrinsic muscles of the back.

      "An inferior fracture of the orbit would likely damage the infraorbital nerve. A blow-out fracture often results in a displaced orbital wall, and in this case, the inferior wall. The infraorbital nerve leaves the skull immediately inferior to the inferior aspect of the orbit, via the infraorbital foramen. Thus, this nerve is the most likely to be damaged. The frontal nerve courses superiorly over the orbital contents before dividing into the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves. The optic nerve is located behind the eyeball and travels posteriorly away from the orbit to enter the cranium. These nerves are therefore unlikely to be damaged.",

    correctAnswer: "Mastoid process",
    explanation:
      "Rinne’s test is often employed during physical examination to determine possible conduction hearing loss. A tuning fork is struck and placed on the mastoid process. It is then placed near the external ear until the patient can no longer detect vibrations. In a normal healthy patient the air conduction will be better than the bone conduction. Rinne’s test is often used in conjunction with the Weber test to rule out sensorineural hearing loss.",

      "Vagus",

      "Phrenic",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Recurrent laryngeal",
    explanation:
      "The right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves loop around the right subclavian artery and the arch of the aorta, respectively. These nerves then travel superiorly in the tracheoesophageal groove to the larynx. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve as a result of surgical intervention or the presence of a tumor in the tracheoesophageal groove would render the patient hoarse. This hoarseness is due to a lack of innervation by the recurrent laryngeal nerve to most of the muscles of the larynx. Damage to the internal laryngeal nerve would cause a loss of sensation above the vocal cords, in addition to a loss of taste on the epiglottis. Damage to the external laryngeal nerve, which can occur during thyroidectomy, will result in a loss of innervation to the cricothyroid muscle, with resultant vocal weakness. Patients with this lesion will often present with a fatigued voice. The vagus nerve gives rise to the recurrent laryngeal nerves; damage to this nerve, however, would result in numerous symptoms beyond just hoarseness.",

    correctAnswer: "Diploic veins",
    explanation:
      "Diploic veins are responsible for communication between the veins of the scalp and the venous sinuses of the brain. Diploic veins are situated within the layers of bone of the skull and connect the emissary veins of the scalp to the venous sinuses located between two layers of dura. The diploe are of clinical significance in that the diploic veins within this layer provide a pathway of communication between the veins of the scalp and underlying venous sinuses of the brain, by means of emissary veins. The emissary veins and diploe provide a potential vascular pathway of infection. The supratrochlear and supraorbital veins are located superficially on the scalp, immediately superior to the upper eyelid, and do not communicate directly with the venous sinuses of the brain. The anterior cerebral vein is an intracranial vein and, as such, does not maintain a direct communication with the external veins of the scalp. The superior sagittal sinus receives blood from the cerebral, diploic, and emissary veins; however, it does not provide a pathway of communication to the veins of the scalp.",

Which of the following nerves will most likely be compressed from the aneurysm?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Trochlear", "Abducens", "Vagus", "Optic"],
    correctAnswer: "Oculomotor",
    explanation:
      "The oculomotor nerve passes between the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the superior cerebellar artery near the junction of the midbrain and pons. The optic nerve arises near the arterial circle of Willis close to the internal carotid artery. Its location would thus prevent compression following an aneurysm at the PCA and superior cerebellar artery. Although the trochlear nerve could be compressed by the superior cerebellar artery, it would not likely be damaged by an aneurysm of the PCA. The abducens nerve is located in the pons, and the vagus is situated near the postolivary sulcus in the medulla. Neither of these nerves is likely to be compressed by the arteries mentioned here due to their more distal location.",

The medial rectus is responsible for adduction of the eye, but in this case the muscle acts as a tether or anchor on the eyeball, preventing lateral excursion (abduction) of the eye. There is no nerve damage here, and the muscle is not paralyzed. The lateral rectus is responsible for abduction of the eye, and the inferior rectus rotates the eyeball downward.

    correctAnswer: "Inferior rectus and inferior oblique",
    explanation:
      "The inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles are entrapped in the fissure between the parts of the fractured orbital floor. Normally, the superior rectus and the inferior oblique are responsible for an upward movement of the eyeball. In this case, however, the broken orbital plate of the maxilla has snared or entrapped the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, causing them to act as anchors on the eyeball, preventing upward movement of the eye. The muscles are not necessarily damaged and there is no apparent nerve injury in this patient. Freeing the muscles from the bone will allow free movement of the eye again, barring any other injury. Damage to the medial and inferior recti would result in a laterally and superiorly deviated eye. The inferior oblique rotates the eye upward and laterally. Damage to this muscle would therefore cause the pupil to be directed somewhat downward. Damage to the medial rectus would result in lateral deviation of the eyeball. The inferior rectus is responsible for downward movement of the eye, and damage to this muscle would result in a superiorly deviated eyeball or an inability to gaze upward symmetrically with both eyes.",

Infections can, likewise, pass within this space. One can insert a needle through the upper eyelid, near the orbital margin, and then direct it deeply toward the orbital apex.

As an example, the affected patient could not turn the pupil to look downward to the left if the right trochlear nerve were paralyzed. This deficiency can make it difficult for individuals to descend stairs if they have trochlear nerve palsy. If the oculomotor nerve were injured, the pupil would be directed “down and out” due to unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique, which are innervated by the abducens and trochlear nerves, respectively. If the optic nerve were injured, the patient would have blindness in the affected eye.

    correctAnswer: "Edinger-Westphal nucleus",
    explanation:
      "The accommodation reflex is performed by constriction of the pupil when trying to focus on a near object. This function is controlled by the parasympathetic nerve fibers carried in the oculomotor nerve from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus of the midbrain that synapse in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic axons act on the sphincter pupillae muscle to cause reduction in pupil diameter and on the ciliary muscle to cause relaxation of the suspensory ligament, allowing the lens to adopt a more spherical shape for near focusing. If there is a lack of accommodation, it means the action of the ciliary muscle is compromised. The ciliary muscle also gets parasympathetic innervation by postganglionic neurons evoked from the ciliary ganglion by GVE fibers of oculomotor nerve whose cell bodies are located in the EdingerWestphal nucleus. The superior salivatory nucleus is involved with lacrimation and salivation, not the ciliary muscle and accommodation. The superior cervical ganglion is a sympathetic ganglion; its postganglionic axons innervate the dilator pupillae muscle, which causes mydriasis, but not the miosis of accommodation. The trigeminal ganglion does not have parasympathetic fibers and does not innervate the ciliary muscle for accommodation (GAS Fig. 8-103).",

      "An acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma or neurolemmoma) is a benign tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), which causes compression of the facial nerve (CN VII). This nerve leads from the inner ear to the brain. Although many such tumors will not grow or grow very slowly, growth can in some cases result ultimately in brainstem compression (as in this example), hydrocephalus, brainstem herniation, and death. It is diagnosed on MRI with gadolinium contrast as shown. Extension of the neuroma into the right internal auditory meatus can be seen on the coronal MRI (see arrow in Fig. 7-9). The exact cause of the tumor is unknown; most people with acoustic neuromas are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60. Due to advances in microsurgery, including intraoperative monitoring of facial and cochlear function, the risks of facial paralysis and hearing loss have been greatly reduced. Many acoustic neuromas can now be treated effectively with both surgery and targeted radiation therapy (gamma knife). The outcomes for those with small acoustic neuromas are better, whereas those with neuromas larger than 2.5 cm are likely to experience significant hearing loss postsurgery.",

      "The angiograph provided clearly shows that the radiopaque medium injected into the patient did not completely fill the common carotid artery. Portions of the internal and external carotid arteries are filled above the common carotid due to “back fill” provided by the collateral circulation. However, vascular supply to the brain is still compromised in this patient, leading to her symptoms.",

    correctAnswer: "Transverse sinus",
    explanation:
      "Mastoiditis is an infection of the air cells within the mastoid process of the temporal bone, often caused by untreated acute otitis media. A known complication of mastoiditis is inflammation of the transverse sinus. Necrosis of the bone due to untreated infection will often affect the transverse sinus. The petrous part of the temporal bone is unlikely to experience inflammation. Infection in the middle ear is usually the preceding event to mastoiditis rather than occurring as a result of it. The occipital sinus is located far posteriorly to the mastoid process and is unlikely to be affected. Because of its position, the internal carotid artery will not be affected by this inflammation",

      "Inferior alveolar",
      "Nerve to mylohyoid",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Lingual",
    explanation:
      "The lingual nerve initially courses directly underneath the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and superficial to the submandibular gland, specifically the submandibular duct. This nerve is therefore at risk for ligation, division, or trauma during excision of the gland and duct. The lingual nerve is part of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and carries fibers from the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). These latter fibers supply taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue and preganglionic parasympathetic axons involved in salivary gland secretion. Fibers of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) give rise to the lingual nerve and supply general sensation to the anterior two thirds of the tongue. The lingual nerve passes deep both to the lateral pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the mandible and subsequently travels deep to the submandibular gland itself. The buccal nerve, also a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, supplies the mucosa of the cheek and is not in close proximity to the gland or duct. The inferior alveolar nerve, though close in proximity to the submandibular gland, travels deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle and later enters the mandibular canal to supply the lower teeth. The nerve to the mylohyoid, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, supplies the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric. Neither of these nerves is at risk for damage during excision of the submandibular gland and duct.",

      "Anterior ethmoidal nerve",
      "Trochlear nerve",
      "Abducens nerve",

    correctAnswer: "Ophthalmic artery",
    explanation:
      "The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery and provides origin to the ocular and orbital vessels, including the central artery of the retina, which supplies the retina. The central artery of the retina is an end artery that has no anastomoses with other arterial sources; therefore, occlusion of this artery will result in loss of vision. The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It is the general sensory nerve for the eye and is the afferent limb of the corneal blink reflex; it has no direct effect on vision. The anterior ethmoidal nerve is a branch of the nasociliary nerve and supplies the anterior ethmoid air cells, the nasal septum, and the lateral walls of the nasal cavity; it also supplies the skin on the bridge of the nose. The trochlear nerve is the fourth of the 12 cranial nerves and innervates the superior oblique muscle, one of the six extraocular muscles. The extraocular muscles function in the movement of the eyeball and not the perception of light. The optic nerve is the second of the 12 cranial nerves and is responsible for vision. A lesion of the optic nerve would lead to blindness; however, based on the location of the patient’s infection, the optic nerve was not affected by the loss of arterial supply.",

The CSF then circulates in the subarachnoid space until it is finally resorbed back into the venous side of the circulation through the arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus.
