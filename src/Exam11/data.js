      "Sciatic nerve injury at the greater sciatic foramen (“doorway to the gluteal region”)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "The lumbosacral trunk at the linea terminalis",
    explanation:
      "The lumbosacral trunk consists of fibers from a portion of the ventral ramus of L4 and all of the ventral ramus of L5 and provides continuity between the lumbar and sacral plexuses. The deep fibular (peroneal) nerve receives supply from segments of L4, L5, and S1. It supplies the extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, the main functions of which are extension of the toes and dorsiflexion of the ankle. L5 is responsible for cutaneous innervation of the dorsum of the foot. Injury to L4 would affect foot inversion by the tibialis anterior. Injury to L4 in the lumbosacral trunk would not affect the patellar tendon reflex, for these fibers are delivered by the femoral nerve. Therefore, an injury to the lumbosacral trunk would result in all of the patient’s symptoms. Nerve root injury at L5 and S1 would result in loss of sensation of the plantar aspect of the foot and motor loss of plantar flexion, with weakness of hip extension and abduction. The fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis are supplied by the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve, which is composed of fibers from segments L5, S1, and S2; these are responsible for eversion of the foot (especially S1). Transection of the fibular (peroneal) division of the sciatic nerve would result in loss of function of all the muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. Injury to the sciatic nerve will affect hamstring muscles and all of the muscles below the knee. Injury to the tibial nerve causes loss of plantar flexion and impaired inversion.",

      "Weakness of abduction of the thigh at the hip joint",
      "Inability to evert the foot",

    correctAnswer:
      "Reduction or loss of sensation from the medial aspect of the leg",
    explanation:
      "The ventral ramus of L4 contains both sensory and motor nerve fibers. Injury from a stab wound could result in loss of sensation from the dermatome supplied by this segment. A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve; L4 dermatome supplies the medial aspect of the leg and foot. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex relates primarily to an S1 deficit. The Achilles tendon reflex is elicited by tapping the calcaneus tendon, which results in plantar flexion. The obturator internus and gluteus medius and minimus are responsible for abduction of the thigh and are innervated by nerves L4, L5, and S1 (with L5 usually dominant). Nerves L5, S1, and S2 are responsible for eversion of the foot (S1 dominant) (GAS Fig. 6-16).",

      "The right side of the pelvis droops or sags when he attempts to stand with his weight supported just by the left lower limb",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "The left side of the pelvis droops or sags when he attempts to stand with his weight supported just by the right lower limb",
    explanation:
      "Injury to the superior gluteal nerve results in a characteristic motor loss, with paralysis of the gluteus medius and minimus. In addition to their role in abducting the thigh, the gluteus medius and minimus function to stabilize the pelvis. When the patient is asked to stand on the limb of the injured side, the pelvis descends on the opposite side, indicating a positive Trendelenburg test. The gluteal, or lurching, gait that results from this injury is characterized by the pelvis drooping to the unaffected side when the opposite leg is raised. In stepping forward, the affected individual leans over the injured side when lifting the good limb off the ground. The uninjured limb is then swung forward. The gluteus maximus, supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve, is the main muscle responsible for allowing a person to rise to a standing position (extending the flexed hip). Spinal nerve roots L1 and L2 and the femoral nerve are responsible for hip flexion. Injury to the left superior gluteal nerve would result in sagging of the right side of the pelvis when the affected individual stands on the left limb. The hamstring muscles, mainly responsible for flexing the knees to allow a person to sit down from a standing position, are innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Saphenous", "Superficial fibular (peroneal)", "Tibial"],
    correctAnswer: "Deep fibular (peroneal)",
    explanation:
      "The deep fibular (peroneal) nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, which are responsible for toe extension, foot dorsiflexion, and inversion. Injury to this nerve will result in foot drop and also loss of sensation between the first and second toes. Injury to the tibial nerve affects the posterior compartment muscles of the leg, which are responsible for plantar flexion and toe flexion, as well as the intrinsic muscles of the sole of the foot. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve splits into the superficial and deep fibular (peroneal) nerves, and these supply both the lateral and anterior compartments. The superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis muscles, which provide eversion of the foot. If the common fibular (peroneal) nerve were injured, eversion of the foot and plantar flexion would be lost in addition to dorsiflexion and inversion. The saphenous nerve, a continuation of the femoral nerve, is a cutaneous nerve that supplies the medial side of the leg and foot and provides no motor innervation.",

      "The femoral ring is the abdominal opening of the femoral canal. A femoral hernia passes through the femoral ring into the femoral canal deep and inferior to the inguinal ligament. It can appear as a bulging at the saphenous hiatus (fossa ovalis) of the deep fascia of the thigh, the hiatus through which the saphenous vein passes to the femoral vein. The superficial inguinal ring is the triangular opening in the aponeurosis of the external abdominal oblique and lies lateral to the pubic tubercle. The deep inguinal ring lies in the transversalis fascia lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. Herniation into either of these two openings is associated with an inguinal hernia.

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Anterior cruciate ligament",
      "Lateral meniscus",
      "Posterior cruciate ligament",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Medial meniscus",
    explanation:
      "The medial meniscus is firmly attached to the medial (tibial) collateral ligament. Damage to the medial collateral ligament often causes concomitant damage to the medial meniscus because of this relationship. The anterior cruciate ligament lies inside the knee joint capsule but outside the synovial cavity. It is taut during extension of the knee and may be torn when the knee is hyperextended. If this were damaged along with the medial meniscus and medial cruciate ligament, an “unhappy triad” (of O’Donoghue, or Donahue, both spellings are correct; also called a “blow knee”) injury would result. The lateral meniscus is not attached to the medial collateral ligament but receives muscular attachment to the popliteus muscle. The posterior cruciate ligament also lies outside of the synovial cavity and limits hyperflexion of the knee. The tendon of the semitendinosus forms one third of the pes anserinus, with the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis making up the other two thirds. The pes anserinus (goose foot) is located at the medial border of the tibial tuberosity, and a portion can be used for surgical repair of the anterior cruciate ligament.",

Which nerve was most likely injured during surgery?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Lateral sural",
      "Superficial fibular (peroneal)",
      "Common fibular (peroneal)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Saphenous",
    explanation:
      "The great saphenous vein is commonly used in coronary artery bypass grafts. Because branches of the saphenous nerve cross the vein in the distal part of the leg, the nerve can be damaged if the vein is stripped from the ankle to the knee. Stripping the vein in the opposite direction can protect the nerve and lessen the postoperative discomfort of patients. The saphenous nerve is responsible for cutaneous innervations on the medial surface of the leg and the medial side of the foot. Injury to this nerve will result in a loss of sensation and also can create chronic dysesthesias in the area. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve bifurcates at the neck of the fibula into the superficial and deep fibular (peroneal) nerves, which continue on to innervate the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg, respectively. These nerves are lateral and therefore not associated with the great saphenous vein. The lateral sural nerve is a cutaneous nerve that arises from the junction of branches from the common fibular (peroneal) nerve and tibial nerve and innervates the skin on the posterior aspect of the leg and lateral side of the foot. This nerve is often harvested for nerve grafts elsewhere in the body. The tibial nerve is a terminal branch of the sciatic nerve that continues deep in the posterior compartment of the leg.",

      "The calcaneofibular ligament is a round cord that passes posteroinferiorly from the tip of the lateral malleolus to the lateral surface of the calcaneus. A forced inversion of the foot can result in tearing of the calcaneofibular ligament and sometimes the anterior talofibular ligament as well. Both of these ligaments act to stabilize the foot and prevent an inversion injury. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament supports the head of the talus. The long plantar ligament passes from the planter surface of the calcaneus to the groove on the cuboid and is important in maintaining the longitudinal arch of the foot. The short plantar ligament is located deep (superior) to the long plantar ligament and extends from the calcaneus to the cuboid and is also involved in maintaining the longitudinal arch of the foot.

    explanation:
      "The common fibular (peroneal) nerve winds around the neck of the fibula before dividing into superficial and deep branches that go on to innervate the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg, respectively. These compartments are responsible for dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, and injury to these nerves would result in deficits in these movements. The tibial nerve lies superficially in the popliteal fossa. This nerve innervates the posterior compartment of the leg, so compression in this area would result in a loss of plantar flexion and weakness of inversion. The lateral compartment of the leg is innervated by the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve and is mainly involved in eversion of the foot. The cutaneous branches of the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve emerge through the deep fascia in the anterolateral aspect of the leg and supply the dorsum of the foot. The anterior compartment of the leg is innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve and is mainly involved in dorsiflexion of the foot. The medial malleolus is an inferiorly directed projection from the medial side of the distal end of the tibia.

      "A 32-year-old patient received a badly placed intramuscular injection to the posterior part of his gluteal region. The needle injured a motor nerve in the area. Later, he had great difficulty rising to a standing position from a seated position. Which muscle was most likely affected by the injury?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Gluteus minimus", "Hamstrings", "Iliopsoas"],
    correctAnswer: "Gluteus maximus",
    explanation:
      "The gluteus maximus is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve, and this muscle is responsible for extension and lateral rotation of the thigh. It is the primary muscle that extends the flexed hip and is used to rise from a seated position. The gluteus minimus is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve and is responsible for abduction of the thigh. Hamstring muscles are innervated by the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve, and these are responsible for extension of the thigh and flexion of the leg. The iliopsoas muscle is innervated by L1 and L2 and the femoral nerve, and flexes the thigh. The obturator internus is innervated by the nerve to the obturator internus and is a lateral rotator of the thigh.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Saphenous", "Superficial fibular (peroneal)", "Sural"],
    correctAnswer: "Deep fibular (peroneal)",
    explanation:
      "The medial branch of the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery and innervates the skin between the contiguous sides of the first and second toes. The saphenous nerve is responsible for cutaneous innervation of the anteromedial aspect of the leg and foot. The superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates most of the dorsum of the foot, with the exception of the area where sensation was lost (medial branch of deep fibular nerve). The common fibular (peroneal) nerve gives off a cutaneous branch, the sural nerve, which innervates the lateral aspect of the leg and lateral side of the foot.",

    correctAnswer:
      "A vessel or vessels were injured at the apex of the femoral triangle",
    explanation:
      "The apex of the femoral triangle occurs at the junction of the adductor longus and sartorius muscles. The subsartorial (Hunter’s) canal begins at this location. Immediately deep to this anatomic point lie the femoral artery, femoral vein, deep femoral artery, and deep femoral vein, often overlying one another in that sequence. This has historically been a site of injuries caused by slipping while handling a very sharp butcher’s knife. For this reason, injuries at this location are referred to as the “butcher’s block” injury. Fatal loss of blood can occur in just a few minutes if pressure, or a tourniquet, is not applied immediately. The common iliac artery becomes the femoral artery at the inguinal ligament. The saphenous vein joins the femoral vein at the saphenous hiatus, or fossa ovalis. The medial circumflex femoral usually arises from the deep femoral artery about 3 to 5 inches inferior to the inguinal ligament, near the origin of the deep femoral artery from the common femoral. Serious blood loss can occur with injury to any of these vessels, although injury to them is not often fatal.",

      "The iliofemoral ligament (“inverted Y ligament of Bigelow”) is the most important ligament reinforcing the joint anteriorly that would resist both hyperextension and lateral rotation at the hip joint. The pubofemoral ligament reinforces the joint inferiorly and limits extension and abduction. The ischiofemoral ligament reinforces the joint posteriorly and limits extension and medial rotation. Negative pressure in the acetabular fossa has nothing to do with resisting hyperextension of the hip joint but does help resist dislocation of the head of the femur.

      "Intertrochanteric fracture of the femur",
      "Thrombosis of the obturator artery",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Intracapsular femoral neck fracture",
    explanation:
      "An intracapsular femoral neck fracture causes avascular necrosis of the femoral head because the fracture damages the radicular branches of the medial and lateral circumflex arteries that pass beneath the ischiofemoral ligament and pierce the femoral neck. Until an individual reaches about 6 to 10 years of age, blood supply to the head of the femur is provided by a branch of the obturator artery that runs with the ligament of the head of the femur. Thereafter, the artery of the ligament of the head of the femur is insignificant. Intertrochanteric fracture of the femur would not damage the blood supply to the head of the femur but would cause complications because the greater trochanter is an attachment site for several gluteal muscles. During childhood the obturator artery provides the artery of the ligament of the head of the femur. Thrombosis of the obturator artery could result in muscular symptoms, although there are several collateral sources of blood supply in the thigh. Comminuted fracture of the extracapsular femoral neck would not ordinarily imperil the vascular supply.",

It is vulnerable to injury as it arises from the common fibular (peroneal) at the neck of the fibula. The muscles denervated are largely dorsiflexors of the foot; hence, foot drop and a high stepping gait can occur. Sensation on the dorsum of the foot is still present; therefore, the superficial branch is mostly or entirely intact, although sensation between the first and second toes would be absent. Femoral nerve injury would result in loss of knee extension. Loss of the sciatic nerve would result in loss of both the tibial and common fibular (peroneal) nerves.

    correctAnswer: "Disc lesion at L5-S1",
    explanation:
      "The Achilles tendon reflex is a function of the triceps surae muscle, composed of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles that insert on the calcaneus. The innervation is provided primarily by spinal nerve S1. The S1 root leaves the vertebral column at the S1 foramen of the sacrum, but a herniated disc at the L5-S1 intervertebral space puts the S1 root under tension, resulting in pain and possible weakness or paralysis of S1 supplied muscles, especially the plantar flexors. A disc lesion at L3-4 would affect the L4 spinal nerve (affecting foot inversion and extension); a lesion at L4-5 would cause problems with L5 (hip abduction and knee flexion). A disc lesion at S1-2 in the sacrum is improbable, unless there was lumbarization of the S1 vertebra.

      "L4 and L5 spinal nerves",
      "Common fibular (peroneal) nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "L4 spinal nerve",
    explanation:
      "An injury to L4 would cause weakness in the patellar reflex and loss of cutaneous innervation to the medial side of the leg. The patellar reflex is used to test L2 to L4 nerve integrity. The motor side of the reflex is primarily derived from spinal nerves L2 and L3, whereas the sensory side of the arc is said to be principally from L4. The L4 spinal nerve supplies the L4 dermatome on the medial side of the leg and foot, by way of the saphenous nerve. It also supplies foot inversion, a function of the tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior muscles; the first is supplied by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve, and the second supplied by the tibial nerve. Foot dorsiflexion is weakened because of partial denervation of the extensor digitorum longus, but L5 is still contributing to that function. The foot is everted because the S1-supplied (by the superficial fibular nerve) fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis are unopposed. The Achilles reflex is also primarily supplied by S1. Hip movements are produced primarily by L5- and S1-supplied muscles, as is knee flexion.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Biceps femoris", "Gastrocnemius", "Semimembranosus"],
    correctAnswer: "Popliteus",

      "When the popliteus contracts, it rotates the distal portion of the femur in a lateral direction. It also draws the lateral meniscus posteriorly, thereby protecting this cartilage as the distal femoral condyle glides and rolls backward, as the knee is flexed. This allows the knee to flex and therefore serves in unlocking the knee. The biceps femoris is a strong flexor of the leg and laterally rotates the knee when it is in a position of flexion. The gastrocnemius is a powerful plantar flexor of the foot. The semimembranosus, similar to the biceps femoris, is a component of the hamstring muscles and is involved in extending the thigh and flexing the leg at the knee joint.

    explanation:
      "Pott’s fracture is a rather archaic term for a fracture of the fibula at the ankle. The term is often used to indicate a bimalleolar fracture of fibula and tibia, perhaps with a tear in the medial collateral ligament, allowing the foot to be deviated laterally. (The medial malleolus will often break before the deltoid ligament tears.) This fracture is also known as Dupuytren’s fracture. The fracture results from abduction and lateral rotation of the foot in extreme eversion. There can also be fracture of the posterior aspect of the distal tibia. The spring ligament, also known as the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, extends from the calcaneus to the navicular bone and is a part of the medial longitudinal arch. This ligament would not be affected in eversion or inversion of the ankle. The plantar ligament, which is composed of the long and short plantar ligaments, supports the lateral longitudinal arch of the foot and would therefore not be affected by inversion or eversion of the foot.

    question:
      "A 43-year-old woman is examined by a neurologist, to whom she complains of pain in her lower limb of 6 months’ duration. She has pain in the gluteal area, thigh, and leg. The neurologist observes reduced sensation over the dorsum and lateral side of the involved foot and some weakness in foot dorsiflexion and eversion. A diagnosis of a piriformis entrapment syndrome is made, with compression of the fibular (peroneal) division of the sciatic nerve. Which of the following conditions did the neurologist also most likely find during her physical examination of the patient?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Paralysis of plantar flexion",
      "Instability of the knee, due to paralysis of the quadriceps femoris",
      "Spasm or clonic contractures of the adductor musculature of the thigh",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Foot drop",
    explanation:
      "Entrapment compression of all or part of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis can mimic disc herniation, most commonly resembling compression of spinal nerve S1. This results in pain down the posterior aspect of the thigh and leg and the lateral side of the foot. In this case, loss of sensation over the dorsum of the foot and weakness of foot extension, in addition to eversion, indicate that more than S1 is involved. Foot drop would be anticipated with fibular (peroneal) nerve involvement. As noted also in a previous question, compression of the common fibular (peroneal) division of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis gives rise to the clinical condition known as piriformis entrapment. This condition is associated with point pain in the gluteal area, pain in the posterior part of the limb, and possible weakness of muscles in the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg. It can be confused with herniated disc (L5) compression of S1 and sciatica. Paralysis of plantar flexion occurs with a lesion of the tibial division of the sciatic nerve or the tibial nerve. Paralysis of the quadriceps is associated with pathology of the femoral nerve. Clonic contraction of the adductors could result from obturator nerve problems.",

      "Three years following a 62-year-old’s hip replacement, the man’s CT scans indicated that two of his larger hip muscles had been replaced by adipose tissue. The opinion is offered that his superior gluteal nerve could have been injured during the replacement procedure, and the muscles supplied by that nerve had atrophied and been replaced by fat. Which of the following muscles receives its innervation from the superior gluteal nerve?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Rectus femoris", "Gluteus maximus", "Piriformis"],
    correctAnswer: "Tensor fasciae latae",
    explanation:
      "The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae muscles. The tensor fasciae latae arises from the iliac crest, inserts into the iliotibial tract of the lateral aspect of the thigh, and assists in flexion of the hip. The rectus femoris is innervated by the femoral nerve; it flexes the hip and extends the knee, thus acting upon two major joints. It arises in part from the anterior inferior iliac spine and the rim of the acetabulum and inserts into the quadriceps tendon. The gluteus maximus is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve. The piriformis and quadratus femoris are both short lateral rotators of the hip.",

    question:
      "A popliteal arterial aneurysm can be very fragile, bursting with great loss of blood and the potential loss of the leg if it is not dealt with safely and effectively. In the 18th century, Dr. John Hunter (1728-1793) discovered that if a primary artery of the thigh is temporarily compressed, blood flow in the popliteal artery can be reduced long enough to treat the aneurysm in the popliteal fossa surgically, with safety. What structure is indicated in Fig. 5-3 that is related to his surgical procedure?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Femoral vein", "Femoral artery", "Gracilis"],
    correctAnswer: "Sartorius",
    explanation:
      "The sartorius is indicated by the arrow in Figure 5-3. This muscle forms the roof of the subsartorial canal (Hunter’s canal), with the adductor longus and vastus medialis forming other muscular borders. The femoral artery and vein, the saphenous nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis, and the medial cutaneous nerve of the thigh all pass into this canal. The femoral artery leaves the canal by passing through the hiatus of the adductor magnus. The saphenous nerve emerges from the canal and from beneath the sartorius on the medial side of the lower limb proximally, thereafter providing sensory branches to the medial side of the lower limb and foot. Dr. Hunter mobilized the sartorius, thereby exposing the femoral artery (which continues as the popliteal artery beyond the adductor hiatus), which could be clamped while an aneurysmal popliteal artery was treated surgically.",

      "A 49-year-old male worker fell from a ladder, with his weight impacting on the heels of his feet. Radiologic examination reveals comminuted calcaneal fractures. After the injury the contraction of which one of the following muscles could most likely increase the pain in the injured foot?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Flexor digitorum profundus",
      "Tibialis posterior",
      "Tibialis anterior",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Gastrocnemius",
    explanation:
      "Contraction of the gastrocnemius on the fractured calcaneus would increase the pain because the gastrocnemius inserts with the soleus upon that bone, via the calcaneal tendon, or tendo Achilles. The flexor digitorum profundus passes the ankle medially to enter the sole of the foot, where it inserts upon the distal phalanges. The tibialis posterior, likewise, passes under the medial malleolus, with complex insertions upon the navicular bone, cuneiform bones, metatarsal bones, and the cuboid bone. The tibialis anterior, a muscle of the anterior leg compartment, inserts upon the navicular bone and, with the tibialis posterior, is a strong invertor of the foot. The fibularis (peroneus) longus is a muscle of the lateral compartment of the leg. It passes under the lateral malleolus, entering the sole of the foot by crossing the lateral surface of the calcaneus, and inserts primarily into the medial cuneiform and base of the first metatarsal bone.",

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Inability to extend the leg at the knee",
      "Foot drop",
      "A plantar flexed and inverted foot",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A dorsiflexed and everted foot",
    explanation:
      "A severe injury of the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa would result in a dorsiflexed and everted foot because of the intact muscles of the extensor (anterior) and evertor (lateral) compartments of the leg. It would result also in some weakening of knee flexion because of loss of the gastrocnemius muscle, which flexes the knee and plantar flexes the foot. The hamstrings also flex the knee, so this function would not be lost. Plantar flexion at the ankle would be paralyzed with the loss of the gastrocnemius and soleus, in addition to the flexors of the toes, and inversion by the tibialis posterior. Foot drop results from loss of the anterior compartment, innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve.",

During physical examination it is observed by the resident that the right lower limb is laterally rotated and noticeably shorter than her left limb. Radiologic examination reveals an intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck. Which of the following arteries supplies the head of the femur in early childhood but no longer in a patient of this age?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Superior gluteal",
      "Lateral circumflex femoral",
      "Inferior gluteal",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A branch of the obturator artery",
    explanation:
      "The obturator artery provides the artery within the ligament of the head of the femur (in about 60% of cases), the artery that supplies the head of the femur, primarily during childhood, later becoming atretic. In the adult this artery supplies only the area of the fovea of the head of the femur. The ligament of the head of the femur arises from the acetabular notch, thereafter receiving the little artery. In some individuals the medial circumflex femoral gives origin to the artery of the head. In the adult the arterial supply of the neck and head is provided by intracapsular branches of the medial circumflex femoral and lateral circumflex femoral arteries that pierce the neck of the femur, with some supply also from the gluteal arteries. The lateral circumflex femoral artery arises from the deep femoral and supplies the vastus lateralis. The pudendal artery arises from the internal iliac and provides blood supply for the structures of the perineum. Quite often, when an older patient with osteoporosis has a hip fracture, the femoral neck may have fractured, precipitating a fall, rather than the fall resulting in the hip fracture.",

      "A 19-year-old patient is admitted to the orthopedic service with a complaint of severe pain in his very swollen and discolored foot. He states that he hurt the foot when jumping from his girlfriend’s bedroom window to the concrete driveway below. Plain film radiographic studies reveal that the head of the talus has become displaced inferiorly, thereby causing the medial longitudinal arch of the foot to fall. What would be the most likely, serious problem in such a case?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Fracture of the cuboid bone",
      "Interruption of the plantar aponeurosis",
      "Sprain of the anterior talofibular ligament",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Tearing of the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament",
    explanation:
      "With sufficient downward force, the head of the talus can break through the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, causing the medial longitudinal arch of the foot to fall, forcing the anterior part of the foot into abduction. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament is attached between the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus and the medial surface of the navicular bone, with the head of the talus lying directly upon the inner surface of the ligament. The cuboid bone is located lateral and anterior to the talus bone and would not be fractured. The plantar aponeurosis, a dense, wide band of tissue beneath the fascia of the sole, attaches to the calcaneus and ends distally in longitudinal bands to each of the toes. It stretches very little, even under very heavy loads, and would not rupture in this case. The anterior talofibular ligament is very often injured in “sprained ankle” but would not be directly involved here. The distal tibiofibular joint is a fibrous (and usually nonsynovial) type of joint (called a syndesmosis) between the tibia and fibula, not involved in the displacement of the talus bone (GAS Fig. 6-98).",

      "A 29-year-old male police officer is examined in a neighborhood clinic, with a complaint of discomfort in the lateral thigh. The physician observes that the policeman is rather overweight and that he is wearing a heavy leather belt, to which numerous objects are attached, including his empty holster. After a thorough physical examination a diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica is confirmed. Which of the following nerves is most likely involved?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Superior gluteal", "Femoral", "Obturator"],
    correctAnswer: "Lateral femoral cutaneous",
    explanation:
      "The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve leaves the pelvis laterally, about 2 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine, passing beneath, or through, the inguinal ligament. As a consequence of its site of exit, any tension upon or compression of the inguinal ligament can affect the nerve. If it is thus affected, the individual may feel burning sensations or pain along the lateral aspect of the thigh, which is the region of distribution of the nerve. Obesity, sudden weight loss, wearing a heavy gun belt, wearing trousers that are too tight (Calvin Klein syndrome), or having someone sitting on another’s lap for an extended period of time can lead to meralgia paresthetica, the painful lateral thigh. The femoral nerve emerges from beneath the middle of the inguinal ligament and is not usually affected by similar traction or compression. The obturator nerve leaves the pelvis through the obturator canal and enters the thigh deeply in a protected location. It innervates the adductor muscles and supplies sensation on the medial aspect of the thigh. The fibular (peroneal) division of the sciatic nerve supplies the muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg and provides sensory fibers for the dorsum and lateral side of the foot. The superior gluteal nerve provides motor supply to the gluteus medius and minimus muscles.",

She states that she stepped on an unseen sharp object while running through the park several days earlier. Emergency surgery is ordered to deal with her tarsal tunnel syndrome. The tarsal tunnel is occupied normally by tendons, vessels, and nerves that pass beneath a very strong band of tissue (flexor retinaculum) on the medial side of the ankle. What is the most anterior of the structures that pass through this tunnel?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Flexor hallucis longus tendon",
      "Plantaris tendon",
      "Tibialis anterior tendon",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Tibialis posterior tendon",
    explanation:
      "The tibialis posterior tendon is the most anterior of the structures that pass under the laciniate ligament (flexor retinaculum) on the medial side of the ankle to enter the sole of the foot. Increases of pressure within the tissues of the plantar aspect of the foot, usually due to increased fluid from hemorrhage, inflammatory processes, or infections, cause tarsal tunnel syndrome, comparable to carpal tunnel syndrome of the hand. The plantar aponeurosis and other fibrous and osseous tissues of the plantar surface cause this area to be relatively nondistensible; therefore, it takes little increase of fluid content to result in pressures adequate to restrict venous drainage and, thereafter, arterial inflow to the region. Fasciotomy of the medial skin and fascia of the foot and the posterior compartment of the leg can be required to reduce the pressure and allow healing to take place. The structures that pass beneath the flexor retinaculum are, from anterior to posterior: Tendon of tibialis posterior; tendon of flexor Digitorum longus; posterior tibial Vessels and Nerve; tendon of flexor Hallucis longus. (This is the basis of the mnemonic: “Tom, Dick, and a Very Nervous Harry.”) Neither the plantaris tendon nor the tibialis anterior tendon pass through this canal (GAS Figs. 6-105 and 6-110).",

    explanation:
      "The second perforating branch of the profunda femoris (deep femoral) artery commonly provides the nutrient artery to the femur, a vessel that passes through a rather large foramen to enter the proximal part of the shaft. The deep circumflex branch of the external iliac passes around the medial aspect of the iliac crest, also supplying the lower lateral part of the anterior abdominal wall. The acetabular branch of the obturator artery supplies tissues in the hip socket, usually including a branch to the ligament of the head of the femur. The lateral circumflex femoral branch of the deep femoral artery supplies the vastus lateralis muscle.

    explanation:
      "The tibial nerve divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves on the medial side of the ankle. These two nerves provide sensation for the sole of the foot. Sensory supply to the dorsum of the foot is provided mostly by the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve, with the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve providing sensation for the skin between the first and second toes. Foot drop would be caused by interruption of the common fibular (peroneal) nerve. Sensory loss to the lateral side of the foot results from loss of the sural nerve. Paralysis of the extensor digitorum brevis would be attributed to injury to the terminal motor branch of the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve.",

Which of the following muscles is most likely to displace the distal fracture fragment?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Soleus", "Semitendinosus", "Gracilis"],
    correctAnswer: "Gastrocnemius",
    explanation:
      "The gastrocnemius muscle arises from the femur just proximal to the femoral condyles. This strong muscle could displace the distal fragment of the fractured femur posteriorly. In addition, the popliteal artery is the deepest structure in the popliteal fossa (right against the popliteal surface of the distal femur) and is susceptible to laceration in this scenario as the fractured end of the distal femoral fragment is pulled against the popliteal artery. Orthopedic surgeons always look for damage to the popliteal artery in a patient with a supracondylar fracture. The soleus arises from the tibia and would have no effect upon the femur. The semitendinosus arises from the ischial tuberosity and inserts medially on the proximal tibia, via the pes anserinus. The tibialis anterior arises from the tibia and inserts mostly onto the navicular bone.",

      "The adductor hallucis muscle inserts upon the lateral side of the proximal phalanx of the great toe, and also the lateral sesamoid bone, by way of its oblique and transverse heads. It is supplied by the lateral plantar nerve. The abductor hallucis inserts upon the medial side of the proximal phalanx and the medial sesamoid bone of the great toe. The sesamoid bones are within the tendon of the flexor hallucis brevis and assist it in its function at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The abductor and flexor hallucis brevis are innervated by the medial plantar nerve. The first dorsal interosseous muscle and the first lumbrical both insert on the medial side of the extensor mechanism of the second toe. The quadratus plantae arises from the calcaneus and inserts on the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. The first lumbrical is supplied by the medial plantar nerve.

Occasionally, one can encounter the lateral cutaneous branch of the iliohypogastric nerve, but this usually causes no serious problem. Certainly, one must stay anterior to a vertical line dropped from the highest point of the ilium. If the injected material is too near the sciatic nerve or other motor nerves, it can infiltrate the connective tissue sheath of the nerve, following the nerve, and result in major insult to the neural elements.

At her specific request, it was decided to inject local anesthetic into the perineum. The genitofemoral and ilioinguinal nerves were infiltrated anteriorly, and a deep injection was made medial to the ischial tuberosity to anesthetize the pudendal nerve, which supplies much of the perineum in most cases. A few minutes later, it became very obvious to those in attendance that the injection had not been effective enough in the central and posterior parts of the perineum. A separate injection was therefore inserted lateral to the ischial tuberosity. What other nerve(s) can provide much of the sensory supply to the perineum in some individuals?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Inferior cluneal nerves",
      "Iliohypogastric nerve",
      "Inferior gluteal nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior femoral cutaneous",
    explanation:
      "The perineal cutaneous branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve provides a significant portion of the cutaneous innervation of the perineum in some individuals and can require separate anesthetic blockade in childbirth or perineal surgery, if other types of anesthesia are not used. The inferior cluneal branches of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve supply the lower part of the gluteal skin. The lateral cutaneous branch of the iliohypogastric nerve provides sensation for the anterior superior aspect of the gluteal area. The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus muscle. The middle cluneal nerves arise from the dorsal primary rami of S1 to S3 and supply skin over the middle of the gluteal region.",

    question:
      "A 55-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for an iliofemoral bypass. The operation is performed successfully and the blood flow between the iliac and femoral arteries is restored. During rehabilitation which of the following arteries should be palpated to monitor good circulation of the lower limb?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Anterior tibial",
      "Deep fibular (peroneal)",
      "Deep plantar",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Dorsalis pedis",
    explanation:
      "The dorsalis pedis is the continuation of the anterior tibial artery into the foot, as it passes the distal end of the tibia and the ankle joint. The pulse of the dorsalis pedis can be felt between the tendon of the extensor hallucis longus and the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus to the second toe. A strong pulse is a positive indicator of circulation through the limb. The fibular (peroneal) artery is a branch of the posterior tibial artery and passes in the calf between the flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior, making it difficult to palpate. The deep plantar artery, the extension of the first dorsal interosseous or lateral plantar arteries, passes deep to the aponeurotic tissues and central muscles of the foot, making palpation unlikely. The dorsal metatarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis pass under cover of the extensor digitorum longus and brevis tendons. Palpable pulses of the first or other dorsal metatarsal arteries can therefore be difficult to detect (GAS Fig. 6-119).",

Which of the following conditions would be expected during physical examination?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Clubfoot",
      "Foot drop",
      "Inability to extend the big toe",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Numbness between the first and second toes",
    explanation:
      "Injury to the dorsalis pedis artery on the dorsum of the foot can also cause trauma to the terminal portion of the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve. In the proximal part of the foot, this could result in loss of sensation between the first and second toes and paralysis of the extensor digitorum brevis and the extensor hallucis brevis muscles. In the distal part of the foot, only the sensory loss might be apparent. Clubfoot is a congenital malformation observed in pediatric patients. This syndrome combines plantar flexion, inversion, and adduction of the foot. Neither extension of the big toe by the extensor hallucis longus nor paralysis of the tibialis anterior (weakness of foot inversion) would occur by this injury because both of these muscles are innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve much more proximally in the leg.",

    question:
      "A 31-year-old woman presents to the department of surgery with a complaint of facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy), which had appeared a year earlier and had resulted in paralysis of muscles of one side of her face. The chief of plastic surgery recommends a nerve graft, taking a cutaneous nerve from the lower limb to replace the defective facial nerve. The surgery is successful. Six months after the procedure, there is restoration of function of previously paralyzed facial muscles. There is an area of skin on the back of the leg laterally and also on the lateral side of the foot that has no sensation. What nerve was used in the grafting procedure?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Superficial fibular (peroneal)",
      "Tibial",
      "Common fibular (peroneal)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sural",
    explanation:
      "The sural nerve is formed by contributions from the tibial nerve and a branch from the common fibular (peroneal) nerve. It provides sensation for the lower lateral portion of the calf and continues beneath the lateral malleolus as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the foot. It is often used for nerve grafting procedures as well as biopsied for diagnostic purposes. When it is grafted to the “living end” of a cut motor or sensory nerve, the severed nerve processes within the “living” nerve grow into the sural nerve sheath, using it as a guide to the distal, surgically anastomosed nerve. Thus, axons from a branch of a functional motor nerve can grow to reinnervate paralyzed muscles. In this case, the surgeon would connect portions of the sural nerve to the functional facial nerve, tunnel it to the opposite side of the face, and join it surgically to the branches of the paralyzed nerve, where it would grow through the now empty nerve sheaths (due to Wallerian degeneration) to the muscles. Growth and reinnervation usually occur at a rate of 1 mm/day (or 1 inch/month) so the time estimated before reinnervation is based on the distance the regenerating fibers need to traverse. The tibial nerve supplies muscles and sensation to the calf and plantar surface of the foot. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the lateral and anterior compartment muscles and sensation to the dorsum of the foot. The saphenous nerve accompanies the great saphenous vein on the medial side of the leg and foot.",

    correctAnswer: "Tibial tuberosity",
    explanation:
      "Osgood-Schlatter disease is also called tibial tuberosity apophysitis and affects the area of the tibial tuberosity. It is not a disease but a problem of overuse, typically in boys of 12 to 14 years or girls 10 to 12 years of age. Very active boys and girls, usually during a growth spurt, are subject to the pain and swelling that occur at the site of attachment of the patellar ligament. The ligament can tear, resulting in a long period of healing following treatment. The medial femoral condyle is the area of attachment of the medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus of the knee joint. The posterior intercondylar eminence is the location of origin of the posterior cruciate ligament. The intercondylar eminence is a bony protuberance on the tibial plateau to which the cruciate ligaments and menisci are attached. The anterolateral tibial tubercle, or Gerdy’s tubercle, is the attachment of the iliotibial band or tract; thus it connects the femur and tibia laterally.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Genu valgus", "Coxa varus", "Coxa valgus"],
    correctAnswer: "Genu varus",
    explanation:
      "The patient has bowlegs, or genu varus. The opposite of this is genu valgus, or knock knee. The normal angle between the femoral shaft and femoral neck is between 120 and 135 degrees. In coxa vara the angle between the shaft and neck of the femur is less than 120 degrees. This can result from fractures, other injuries, or congenital softness of the bone of the femoral neck. This defect results in limb shortening and limping. In coxa valga there is an increase in femoral shaft neck angulation, which can lead to hip subluxation or dislocation. Coxa valga results from weakness of the adductor musculature. Hallux valgus is commonly known as bunion. In this deformity the big toe points toward the little toe and may override the second toe; the base of the first metatarsal points medially, with a swollen bursal sac at the metatarsophalangeal joint.

      "The patellar reflex appears to be markedly reduced in a 33-year-old diabetic female patient, due to deficient vascular supply of the nerves of her lower limb. The tendon of which of the following muscles is stretched during the patellar reflex?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Quadratus femoris", "Sartorius", "Pectineus"],
    correctAnswer: "Quadriceps femoris",
    explanation:
      "The patellar ligament is a very heavy ligament that connects the patella to the tibial tuberosity; it provides the insertion of the quadriceps femoris tendon upon the tibia. The patella can be thought of as a bone (a sesamoid bone) that develops within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle. When the reflex hammer strikes the patellar ligament, it stretches the ligament slightly for a brief time, resulting in reflex contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscles. This reflex arc is elicited by the femoral nerve (L4 sensory input component and L2, L3 motor output). The quadriceps femoris includes the rectus femoris and the vastus lateralis, intermedius, and medialis. The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body. A sesamoid bone is a bone that develops within a tendon. The quadratus femoris muscle of the gluteal area arises from the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the femur proximally. The sartorius arises from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts on the proximal, medial aspect of the tibia as one of the three tendinous components of the pes anserinus (goose foot). The biceps femoris of the posterior thigh has a long head that arises from the ischial tuberosity and a short head that arises from the femur; they insert on the head of the fibula.",

Which of the following bones will also most likely be affected?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Navicular", "Calcaneus", "Cuneiform"],
    correctAnswer: "Talus",
    explanation:
      "The talus can be rotated externally when the ankle sustains a trimalleolar fracture, also called a Henderson fracture. The fracture may be caused by eversion and posterior displacement of the talus. This injury involves the fracture of the distal fibula (lateral malleolus); the medial malleolus of the tibia; and the posterior portion, or lip, of the tibial plafond (the distal articular portion of the tibia, sometimes referred to as the posterior malleolus). The posterior part of the plafond is not truly a malleolus but acts this way in this type of twisting fracture of the ankle. The talus can be forced from its normal position in this fracture, adding to the instability of the ankle. The other bones listed are relatively far from the site of the fractures. The calcaneus resides beneath the talus and articulates distally with the cuboid bone. The head of the talus articulates also with the navicular bone.

      "Hallux valgus, or lateral displacement of the great toe, usually presents as pain over the prominent metatarsal head, due to rubbing from shoes, and it can be associated with deformity of the second toe, which then tends to override the great toe. Hallux valgus is commonly known as bunion. In this deformity the big toe points toward the little toe; the base of the first metatarsal points medially, with a swollen bursal sac at the metatarsophalangeal joint.

Radiologic and physical examinations give evidence of constant extension at the metatarsophalangeal joints, hyperflexion at the proximal interphalangeal joints, and extension of distal interphalangeal joints (Fig. 5-6). Which of the following terms is most accurate to describe the signs of physical examination?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Pes planus", "Pes cavus", "Claw toes"],
    correctAnswer: "Hammertoes",
    explanation:
      "The patient’s complaint is due to her case of hammertoes. Hammer toe can affect any toe but most commonly the second toe, then the third or fourth toes. It results most commonly from wearing shoes that are too short or shoes with heels that are too high. In hammertoe, the metatarsophalangeal joint is extended, the proximal interphalangeal joint is flexed, and the distal phalanx points downward, looking like a hammer. Hammertoe can occur as a result of a bunion. Calluses, or painful corns, can form on the dorsal surface of the joints. In claw toe, both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints are strongly flexed, the result of muscle imbalance in the foot. Either hammertoe or claw toe can occur from arthritic changes. Pes cavus is the opposite of flat foot. In this case the patient has a high, flexed plantar arch; it occurs as a result of hereditary motor and sensory neural problems. It is painful because of metatarsal compression.",

These usually involve pain in the gluteal area, posterior thigh, and leg, most frequently resembling a disc lesion at L5-S1, with compression of the S1 spinal nerve. L4 compression would be rather unusual but would involve the quadriceps femoris knee extension, foot inversion, and sensory loss on the medial side of the leg.

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Gluteal crush injury",
    explanation:
      "Incapacitation and unconsciousness from use of cocaine and other powerful narcotics have led to numerous cases of the “gluteal crush syndrome.” Compression of the gluteal region while supine for extended periods of time can lead to gluteal crush injury, in which the nerves and vessels of the gluteal area are compressed. This can result in loss of gluteal muscles and other soft tissues and sciatic nerve compression. The nerve compression can cause paralysis of knee flexors and muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg, with sensory loss in the posterior thigh and leg and sensory loss in the foot. Tibial nerve loss would not result in loss of dorsiflexion of the foot nor generalized sensory loss. Neither piriformis entrapment nor femoral nerve entrapment is associated with loss of gluteal musculature, nor loss of knee flexion or plantar flexion of the foot, nor do they lead to general sensory loss in the limb.",

      "Acetabular branch of obturator",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Ascending branch of medial circumflex femoral",
    explanation:
      "In infants and children until about the age of 8 years, the head of the femur gets its arterial supply by a direct branch of the obturator artery (variably, the medial circumflex femoral). The arterial supply reaches the head of the femur at the fovea capitis by traveling along the ligament of the head of the femur. This source of supply is replaced later by vessels such as branches of the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral that pass into foramina of the neck of the femur within the capsule of the hip joint. Similar branches can arise from the lateral circumflex femoral and gluteal arteries. The deep circumflex iliac artery arises from the external iliac artery and supplies branches to the ilium, the iliacus muscle, and lower portions of the abdominal wall. The acetabular branch of the obturator artery often provides the branch to the head of the femur, an artery that normally regresses early in life, so that it supplies only the immediate area of the fovea capitis. The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral supplies the vastus lateralis muscle and participates in anastomoses at the knee. The second perforating branch of the deep femoral artery often supplies the nutrient artery of the shaft of the femur (GAS Fig. 6-30).",

    explanation:
      "Excessive compression of the prepatellar bursa, as in working on bended knees, can result in pain and swelling of the prepatellar bursa, the so called housemaid’s knee. Prepatellar bursitis affects plumbers, carpet layers, and other people who spend a lot of time on their knees. The bursa normally enables the patella to move smoothly under the skin. The constant friction of these occupations irritates this small lubricating sac (bursa) located just in front of the patella, resulting in a deformable tense cushion of fluid. Treatment usually requires simple drainage, but this may need to be repeated and occasionally steroids introduced. Excessive irritation of the infrapatellar bursa in kneeling for frequent and long periods of time (as in prayer) can result in “parson’s knee.” The posterior cruciate ligament of the knee can be injured in sudden, strong flexion of the knee, with posterior displacement of the tibia upon the femur. The patellar retinacula are strong, tendinous bands of tissue that join the quadriceps tendon to the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles.

    correctAnswer: "Ligament of the head of the femur",
    explanation:
      "The ligament of the head of the femur conveys a small blood vessel for supply of the head of the femur (primarily in childhood). The ligament is stretched during abduction and lateral rotation of the hip joint and has an important role in stabilizing an infant’s hip joint before walking. It has the potential to increase stability of the joint in hip reconstruction in developmental hip dysplasia in the pediatric population. The strength of this ligament is comparable to the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. The iliofemoral ligament (the inverted “Y-shaped ligament of Bigelow”) on the anterior aspect of the hip bone resists hyperextension of the hip joint. The pubofemoral ligament arises from the pubic bone and is located on the inferior side of the hip joint; it resists abduction of the joint. The ischiofemoral ligament is a triangular band of strong fibers that arises from the ischium and winds upward and laterally over the femoral neck, strengthening the capsule posteriorly. The transverse acetabular ligament attaches to the margins of the acetabular notch and provides origin for the ligament of the head of the femur.

With the patient seated, a rupture of the ligament can be demonstrated by the ability to push the tibia posteriorly under the femur. This is called the posterior drawer sign because it’s similar to pushing in a desk drawer. The anterior cruciate ligament resists knee hyperextension. The lateral collateral ligament is a thick, cordlike band that passes from the lateral femoral condyle to the head of the fibula. It is located external to the capsule of the knee joint. The lateral meniscus is a nearly circular band of fibrocartilage that is located laterally within the knee joint. It is less frequently injured than the medial meniscus because it is not attached to the joint capsule or other ligaments.

      "Exaggerated height of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot",
      "Collapse of long plantar ligament",
      "Collapse of deltoid ligament",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Collapse of medial longitudinal arch, with eversion and abduction of the forefoot",
    explanation:
      "Flat foot (pes planus) is due to flattening of the medial longitudinal arch. Often congenital, it may be associated with minor structural anomalies of the tarsal bones. This condition can be seen in wet footprints in which the medial surface of the sole (normally raised in an arch) is visible. Treatment may include intensive foot exercises or arch supports worn in the shoes. Occasionally, surgery is needed in the form of arthrodesis (fusion of the tarsal bones). Pes cavus is a deformity of the foot characterized by a very high medial arch and hyperextension of the toes. The long plantar ligament is a passive ligament of the longitudinal arch. The long plantar ligament connects the calcaneus and cuboid bones. It can be involved with the plantar aponeurosis in plantar fasciitis. The long plantar ligament converts the cuboid groove into a canal for the tendon of the fibularis (peroneus) longus. The deltoid ligament is a very strong ligament that interconnects the tibia with the navicular, calcaneus, and talus bones. The medial malleolus will usually fracture before this ligament will tear. The plantar calcaneonavicular, or spring, ligament is a key element in the medial longitudinal arch; it supports the head of the talus bone and thereby is subject to vertical forces exerted through the lower limbs. In the present case, the bilateral pes planus appears to be the result of gradual weakening and failure of the arches.",

    explanation:
      "The “unhappy triad” (of O’Donoghue) is composed of the medial collateral ligament, medial meniscus, and anterior cruciate ligament. Sudden, forceful thrusts against the lateral side of the knee put tension on the medial collateral ligament, which can then rupture. The medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament so that it then tears. The anterior cruciate ligament resists hyperextension of the knee; thus, it is the third structure that ruptures in the “unhappy triad” of the knee.",

    correctAnswer: "1.5 cm lateral to the femoral pulse",
    explanation:
      "If the needle is inserted about 1.5 cm lateral to the maximal femoral pulse, it will intersect the femoral nerve in most cases. (Fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance is advisable to avoid iatrogenic errors.) The deep inguinal ring is located about 4 cm superolateral to the pubic tubercle and very close to the origin of the inferior epigastric vessels from the external iliac artery and vein. The approximate site of exit of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve from the abdomen is 1.5 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. Injections 1.5 cm medial to the femoral artery pulse will enter the femoral vein. Midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis can vary approximately 1.5 cm either medial or lateral from the femoral artery.",

      "Morton’s neuroma most commonly involves compression (and possible enlargement) of an anastomosing branch that connects the medial and lateral plantar nerves between the third and fourth toes. The pain can be severe. The medial plantar nerve provides sensation for the medial three and a half toes; the lateral plantar nerve supplies the little toe and half of the fourth toe. The neural interconnection can be compressed between the transverse metatarsal ligament and the floor. Women are 10 times more likely than men to be afflicted with this problem, most likely due to wearing shoes that put excessive stress on the forefoot. In about 80% of cases the pain can be eased with different (less confining) shoes or cortisone injections.",

    explanation:
      "Inflammation of the plantar aponeurosis is referred to as plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is a common clinical condition that results from tearing or inflammation of the tough band of tissue stretching from the calcaneus to the ball of the foot (the plantar aponeurosis). It happens frequently to people who are on their feet all day, such as mail carriers, or engaged in athletics, especially in running and jumping. The pain of plantar fasciitis is usually most significant in the morning, just after you get up from bed and begin to walk.

      "A 5-month-old baby boy is admitted to the pediatric orthopedic clinic. During physical examination it is noted that the baby has inversion and adduction of the forefoot relative to the hindfoot and plantar flexion. Which of the following terms is diagnostic for the signs observed on physical examination?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Coxa vara", "Hallux varus", "Plantar fasciitis"],
    correctAnswer: "Talipes equinovarus",
    explanation:
      "The child has the problem of talipes equinovarus, or clubfoot. Clubfoot is a congenital malformation observed in about 1 in 1000 pediatric patients and first appears in the first trimester of pregnancy. This syndrome combines plantar flexion, inversion, and adduction of the foot. The heel is drawn upward by the tendo calcaneus and turned inward; the forefoot is also adducted, or turned inward. The foot usually is smaller than normal. In coxa vara, the angle between the femoral shaft and neck is reduced to less than 120 degrees, often due to excessive activity of the adductor musculature. Hallux valgus is also known as bunion, in which the big toe points laterally. Hallux varus involves a medial deviation of the first metatarsal or big toe, sometimes the result of attempted correction of bunions. It can also result from arthritis or muscular problems.",

    question:
      "A 71-year-old man is admitted to the orthopedic clinic with difficulties walking. The patient has a past history of polio. Physical and radiologic examinations reveal extension at the metatarsophalangeal joints with flexion of both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Which of the following descriptions is most appropriate for this patient’s condition?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Hallux valgus", "Pes planus", "Hammertoes"],
    correctAnswer: "Claw toes",
    explanation:
      "In claw toe, both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints are strongly flexed, the result of muscle imbalance in the foot. With muscular imbalance, the extensors of the interphalangeal joints are overpowered by the long flexors. The metatarsophalangeal joint is extended, whereas in hammertoe it can be in a neutral position. Either hammer toe or claw toe can occur from arthritic changes. Hammertoe can affect any toe, but it most commonly affects the second toe, then the third or fourth toes. It results most commonly from wearing shoes that are too short or shoes with heels that are too high. In hammertoe, the metatarsophalangeal joint is extended, the proximal interphalangeal joint is flexed, and the distal phalanx may be dorsiflexed, or it may point downward, looking like a hammer. Hammertoe can occur as a result of a bunion. Calluses, or painful corns, can form on the dorsal surface of the joints. Hallux valgus is more commonly referred to as a bunion. The big toe is angulated toward the little toe and may override the second toe. The base of the first metatarsal bone is directed medially and is subject, painfully, to compression. Pes cavus is the opposite of flat foot; the patient has a high, flexed plantar arch. Pes cavus occurs as a result of hereditary motor and sensory neural problems. It is painful because of metatarsal compression.",

    explanation:
      "The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve arises from nerves S1 to S3. It provides inferior cluneal branches to the lower portion of the gluteal region and a perineal branch to the perineum and supplies sensation to the posterior thigh to the level of the popliteal fossa. Superior gluteal innervation arises from dorsal rami of L1 to L3. Meralgia paresthetica is the occurrence of pain or burning sensations on the lateral thigh, from compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The sural nerve, sensory to the lower calf and lateral foot, arises from contributions from the tibial nerve and common fibular (peroneal) nerve. The posterior femoral cutaneous is a sensory nerve and does not innervate muscles.",

      "4.5 cm lateral to the pubic tubercle",
      "Midpoint of the inguinal skin crease",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Medial aspect of femoral head",
    explanation:
      "Femoral artery puncture is one of the most common vascular procedures. The femoral artery can be localized often by simply feeling for the strongest point of the femoral pulse just inferior to the inguinal ligament. The femoral artery can be accessed with fluoroscopic assistance at the medial edge of the upper portion of the head of the femur. It is easily localized by Doppler ultrasound if the pulse is difficult to detect, such as in an obese patient. It is here that catheters are passed into the femoral artery for catheterization of abdominopelvic and thoracic structures and for antegrade angiography. It is also a site where arterial blood can be obtained for gas analysis. The midinguinal point, halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis, can be either medial or lateral to the femoral artery and is not a dependable landmark. A needle inserted at the level of the inguinal crease, or inferior to the femoral head, can enter the femoral artery distal to the origin of the deep femoral artery, presenting more risk for accidental vascular injury. Four centimeters lateral to the pubic tubercle overlies the deep inguinal ring, with potential entry to spermatic cord, femoral vein, or artery. The fossa ovalis is the opening in the deep fascia of the thigh for the termination of the great saphenous vein in the femoral vein.",

During physical examination there is pain and swelling of the knee, in addition to locking of the knee in full extension. Radiologic examination reveals a bucket handle meniscal tear (Fig. 5-12). Which of the following ligaments is most likely injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Posterior cruciate",
      "Medial collateral",
      "Lateral collateral",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Anterior cruciate",
    explanation:
      "Both the medial and lateral menisci are subject to rotational injuries and may be torn. The medial meniscus is much more liable to injury because it is attached to the fused deep layer of the medial collateral ligament and joint capsule. The lateral meniscus is separated from the fibular collateral ligament and is external to the capsule of the knee joint. Commonly seen in football players’ knees, meniscal tears are usually diagnosed by MRI or by arthroscopy. The presenting symptoms of tearing may be pain and swelling, or locking of the knee. Locking of the knee suggests a bucket handle tear, in which a partly detached cartilage wedges between the tibia and femur, inhibiting further movement. A bucket handle tear is often associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. Sometimes a momentary click can be heard in flexion/extension movements of the knee. Meniscectomy is a successful operation, but currently there is greater emphasis on repairing small tears. Meniscal cysts can form secondary to meniscal tears and some of these can also be treated arthroscopically.",

What is the landmark to feel the pulse of the femoral artery?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Adductor canal", "Popliteal fossa", "Inguinal canal"],
    correctAnswer: "Femoral triangle",
    explanation:
      "The femoral triangle is the best place to palpate the femoral pulse. It is bounded by the sartorius muscle laterally, adductor longus medially, and the inguinal ligament superiorly. It contains the femoral vein, artery, and nerve (from medial to lateral, respectively). The adductor canal lies deep between the anterior and medial compartments of the thigh and therefore cannot be palpated. The popliteal fossa is the fossa at the back of the knee and contains the popliteal artery and vein, tibial nerve, and common fibular (peroneal) nerve. The femoral pulse cannot be palpated here.

What reference structure would be found immediately lateral to the herniated structures?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Femoral artery", "Pectineus muscle", "Femoral nerve"],
    correctAnswer: "Femoral vein",
    explanation:
      "In a femoral hernia, abdominal contents are forced through the femoral ring, which is just lateral to the lacunar ligament (of Gimbernat) and just medial to the femoral vein. The femoral vein would be found immediately lateral to the femoral hernia. This is correct in most cases because in the majority of people, the femoral vein is found more medial to both the femoral artery and nerve in the femoral triangle.

It prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. This is usually tested with the posterior drawer test, in which the physician pushes the tibia backward while the knee is flexed in an attempt to displace it posteriorly. This is called the positive posterior drawer sign. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior displacement of the tibia on the femur.

    explanation:
      "A lateral blow to the knee often produces a trio of injuries referred to as the “unhappy triad.” This involves damage to the anterior cruciate ligament, medial meniscus, and medial collateral ligament. The medial meniscus and medial collateral ligament are often damaged together, as they are tightly attached to each other. The lateral collateral ligament and lateral meniscus would not be damaged because a blow to the lateral knee would not put strain on these structures. Damage to the posterior cruciate ligament would produce a positive “posterior drawer sign” and is typically damaged during a blow to the medial side of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament is stronger than the anterior and is only typically damaged when a person falls on the tibial tuberosity of a flexed knee.

      "The rough bony projection at the junction of the inferior end of the body of the ischium and its ramus is the large ischial tuberosity. Much of the body’s weight rests on these tuberosities when sitting, and it provides the proximal, tendinous attachment of the posterior thigh muscles (hamstring muscles and adductor magnus). The hamstring muscles are associated with hip extension and knee flexion. The adduction of the hip joint will be affected slightly because the adductor magnus is affected, although the rest of the adductor muscles are intact.",

    correctAnswer: "Superomedial quadrant of the buttock",
    explanation:
      "The gluteal region (buttocks) is a common site for intramuscular injection of drugs, particularly if the volume of the injection is large. To avoid injury to the underlying sciatic nerve, the injection should be given well forward on the upper outer quadrant of the buttock (superolateral quadrant). The patient is showing the Trendelenburg gait pattern (or gluteus medius lurch), which is caused by weakness of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles. These muscles are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1), which emerges from the greater sciatic notch above the upper border of the piriformis and immediately disappears beneath the posterior border of the gluteus medius and runs forward between the gluteus medius and minimus. Intramuscular injection in the upper inner quadrant (superomedially) is most likely to damage this nerve. The sciatic nerve is most likely damaged in the inferomedial quadrant of the buttock.",

      "Fibular (lateral) collateral",
      "Tibial (medial) collateral",
      "Patellar",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Anterior cruciate",
    explanation:
      "The anterior cruciate ligament is attached to the anterior intercondylar area and the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. Posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia is prevented by the ACL. With the knee joint flexed, the ACL prevents the tibia from being pulled anteriorly. The posterior cruciate ligament is stronger, shorter, and broader, less oblique, and prevents anterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. Lateral collateral ligaments are cordlike and are attached proximally to the lateral side of the head of the fibula overlapped by the tendon of biceps femoris. The medial collateral ligament is a flat band and is attached above to the medial condyle of the femur and below to the medial surface of the shaft of the tibia. It is firmly attached to the edge of the medial meniscus and consequently is more prone to be injured. The oblique popliteal ligament is a tendinous expansion derived from the semimembranosus muscle. It strengthens the posterior aspect of the knee joint capsule. The patellar ligament (tendon) connects the lower border of the patella with the smooth convexity on the tuberosity of the tibia. It represents the continuation of the quadriceps tendon.",

      "The obturator membrane is a thin membrane that covers the obturator foramen except at its superior part. The obturator nerve exits the pelvis and enters into the medial compartment of the thigh by passing through the obturator canal alongside the obturator vessels. Traumatic injuries to the membrane will most likely lead to obturator nerve damage. The obturator nerve supplies motor innervations to the adductor muscles of the thigh (gracilis, obturator externus, adductor longus, adductor brevis and a portion of the adductor magnus). It also provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the thigh. Urinary and fecal incontinence is mediated by autonomic nerves and the pudendal nerve. Both nerves have no relationship with the obturator membrane. The gluteus medius and minimus muscles are the main hip abductors. They also stabilize the hip on the swing-side during motion. These muscles are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve, which leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle. Flexors of the hip found in the anterior compartment of the thigh are innervated by the femoral nerve, which has no relationship with the obturator membrane.

The femur is usually pushed posteriorly during stair climbing, an action that is opposed by a normal anterior cruciate ligament. Injury to the anterior cruciate ligament results in posterior displacement of the femur in relation to the tibia with difficulty climbing stairs. Extension of the knee is done mainly by the quadriceps femoris muscle. The posterior thigh muscles provide flexion of the knee.

The popliteal bursa is located behind the knee, away from the site of injury. The superficial infrapatellar bursa is located below the patella, between the patella ligament and the skin. The deep infrapatellar bursa is located below the site of the injury, between the upper part of the tibia and the patella ligament. The gastrocnemius bursa is at the back of the knee, as well as below the level of the injury.",

    question:
      "A 53-year-old woman reports difficulty in walking. Physical examination showed a positive Trendelenburg sign when she is asked to stand on her right leg. Which nerve has been compromised to produce the positive sign?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Sciatic",
      "Right inferior gluteal",
      "Left inferior gluteal",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Right superior gluteal",
    explanation:
      "The right superior gluteal nerve is the correct choice. When a person stands on one leg or walks, the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor muscles of the fascia latae act in synergy to stabilize the hip joint by abducting the hip (pelvic tilt). These muscles receive their innervation from the superior gluteal nerve. The abductors of the hip, as they contract to maintain the stability of the hip joint, draw the pelvis forcefully toward the weigh-bearing leg, causing the opposite side of the pelvis to tilt in that same direction. The right superior gluteal nerve innervates its ipsilateral medius, minimus, and tensor muscles of the fascia latae. Loss of these muscles results in a positive Trendelenburg sign with the pelvis dropping on the left side.",

    question:
      "A 45-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department after a fall and subsequent leg injury. On physical examination the patient has a foot drop but eversion is unaffected. Which nerve is most likely injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Tibial",
      "Common fibular (peroneal)",
      "Superficial fibular (peroneal)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Deep fibular (peroneal)",
    explanation:
      "The deep fibular (peroneal) nerve along with the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve are branches of the common fibular nerve. The deep fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg dorsiflexors of the foot and the skin between the great toe and second toes, while the superficial fibular nerve innervates the lateral compartment muscles of the leg, which are evertors of the foot and the skin on most of the dorsum of the foot. If the common fibular nerve were damaged all the structures that receive innervation via this nerve will be compromising dorsiflexion and eversion. Damage to the superficial fibular nerve affects the ability to evert the foot but does not result in foot drop, making the deep fibular nerve, which innervates the dorsiflexors of the foot, the best choice as the injury describes foot drop with the ability to evert the foot conserved. The saphenous nerve is a cutaneous nerve, while the tibial nerve innervates posterior compartment muscles.",

    question:
      "A 48-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe back pain for 2 days. The pain radiates down to the buttock, posterior thigh, and posterolateral leg. He also has numbness on the lateral side of his left foot. On physical examination sensation to pain is decreased over the lateral side of the left foot. Deep tendon reflexes are absent at the left ankle, and there is a weakness of dorsiflexion of the left foot. Compression of which of the following nerve roots is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["T12", "L2", "L4"],
    correctAnswer: "S1",
    explanation:
      "The S1 nerve root provides cutaneous innervation to the lateral aspect of the ankle, the lateral sides of the dorsum and sole of foot, and motor innervation to the gastrocnemius muscle, which plantar flexes the foot and contracts during the ankle jerk reflex. It receives its innervation from the S1, S2 nerve roots via the tibial nerve, making D the correct choice. T12 roots do not reach the foot; L2 roots will reach the hip region and thigh; L4 innervates the invertors of the foot and skin over medial leg, ankle, and side of foot; and S3 innervates the sitting area of the buttocks, posterior scrotum or labia, and the small muscles of the foot.",

    question:
      "A 45-year-old man after being diagnosed with a posterior acetabular fracture is taken to the operating room to repair the fracture. During the neurological examination the physician notices loss of sensation to the skin of the inferior half of the buttocks, posterior, and upper medial thigh. The patient had a normal neurovascular examination preoperatively. Which of the following nerves was mostly likely damaged during the operation?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Obturator nerve", "Sciatic", "Femoral"],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior femoral cutaneous",
    explanation:
      "All the branches of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve are cutaneous. It arises from the dorsal divisions of the first and second and the ventral divisions of the second and third sacral nerves and travels through the greater sciatic foramen beneath the piriformis muscle to innervate the shin over the lower parts of the gluteus maximus muscle through the inferior clunial nerves and the posterior surface of the thigh and leg and perineum via its perineal branches. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which innervates the lateral surface of the thigh, is an incorrect choice; the obturator, sciatic, and femoral nerves all have both motor and sensory branches and can be eliminated, since no motor deficits were described.",

    question:
      "A 30-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department with complaints of pain to the anterior left thigh. While participating in a 100-meter race, she felt a sudden onset of pain in the anterior midthigh area and could only limp to the finish line. Physical examination revealed a swollen, tender right thigh anteriorly. Extension of the knee was limited due to pain. Ultrasonography of the area revealed a defect in the fibers of the quadriceps muscle, confirmed by CT scan of the limb. Which of the following is the embryologic origin of the affected structure?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Intermediate mesoderm",
      "Lateral plate mesoderm",
      "Dorsolateral migration of neural crest cells",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Migration of cells from paraxial mesoderm",
    explanation:
      "The muscles of the limbs develop from the myotome component of the somites. The somites are condensations of paraxial mesoderm that form after the formation of the trilaminar disc. The lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to the serous membranes, coverings of organs and the heart. The intermediate mesoderm gives rise to the urogenital system and its accessory glands. The chondrification centers precede the formation of the muscles, as it gives the skeletal framework. Neural crest cells give rise to dorsal root ganglia, leptomeninges, Schwann cells, sympathetic ganglia, and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.",

    question:
      "A 32-year-old man was brought to the emergency with complaints of pain to the left ankle and leg. During a game of football, his left foot landed in a hole as he was running on an uneven dirt field. He was unable subsequently bear weight on his left limb. On examination, the right ankle was swollen, with exquisite tenderness over the right medial malleolus and over the distal third of the lateral right leg. Radiographs of the right lower limb revealed an inferiorly displaced fracture of the right medial malleolus and a spiral fracture of the distal third of the right fibula. Which of the following describes the most likely mechanism of this injury?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Forceful inversion of the ankle",
      "Direct upward force from the talus into the tibial plafond",
      "Forceful dorsiflexion of the foot",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Forceful external rotation and eversion of the ankle",
    explanation:
      "Forceful external rotation and eversion of the ankle often leads to this type of injury as the bony components are pushed apart forcefully. It is commonly referred to as a Pott fracture (the medial malleolus is pulled forcefully by the strong deltoid ligament as the talus moves laterally, causing a fracture of the lateral malleolus). Inversion, extreme plantar flexion, and forceful dorsiflexion cause a rupture of the ligaments. Direct upward force of the talus is usually due to a fall from great height and will damage the spine and calcaneus.",

    correctAnswer: "Deep fibular (peroneal)",
    explanation:
      "Knowledge of Hilton’s Law would lead to this correct answer. This law in a modified form, can be remembered as “a joint is innervated by the same nerves that innervate the muscles that move that joint.” A complete explanation of this law can be found in an article by Hebert-Blouin et al., Clinical Anatomy 27:548-555, 2013. The deep fibular (peroneal) nerve is the only nerve listed that innervates muscles that move the ankle joint.",
