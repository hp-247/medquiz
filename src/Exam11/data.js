    ],

    question:
      'An elderly woman who suffers from osteoprosis falls and "breaks her hip." The orthopedic surgeon recommends that the proximal part of the femur be replaced with a prosthesis because of the likelihood of avascular necrosis of the head of the femur. What artery supplying the neck and head of the femur might have been lacerated by the fracture?',
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Inferior gluteal artery",
      "Pudental artery",
      "Profunda femoral artery",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Medial circumflex femoral artery",
    explanation:
      "The head of the femur may undergo avascular necrosis as a result of the disruption of branches of the medial circumflex femoral artery, the main source of arterial blood supply to the head and neck of the femur.",

    question:
      "A traumatic injury to the lateral aspect of a patient's knee tears several structures at the knee joint. An examination reveals a positive anterior drawer sign and a clicking sound when the patient attempts to extend the leg at the knee. Of the following structures, which one was most likely spared from being stretched or torn in this knee injury?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Medial meniscus",
      "Tibial collateral ligament",
      "Anterior cruciate ligament",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Fibular collateral ligament",
    explanation:
      "A traumatic blow to the lateral aspect of the knee most commonly injures the tibial collateral ligament, the medial meniscus, and the anterior cruciate ligament (the terrible triad) and may tear tendons that cross the medial aspect of the joint",

    question:
      "A health care worker inadvertently administers an injection to the gluteal region that results in a lesion to a nerve. The patient begins to walk with an altered gait. Upon raising the left foot off the ground during gait, the patient leans to the right, and when standing on the right foot without leaning, the left buttock seems to sag. What muscle might have been weakened by the nerve lesion?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Gluteus maximus muscle",
      "Piriformis muscle",
      "Semitendinosus muscle",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Gluteus medius muscle",
    explanation:
      "A lesion of the superior gluteal nerve may result in weakness in the ability to abduct the thigh at the hip and keep pelvis level during gait. Patients have a waddling, or Trendelenburg, gait, in which the pelvis sags on the side of the unsupported limb because of weakness of the gluteus medius muscle.",

      "Popliteal artery",
      "Posterior tibial artery",
      "Medial plantar artery",
