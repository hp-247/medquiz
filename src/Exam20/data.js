      "Somatic cell gene therapy to replace one ADA gene copy in bone marrow lym- phoblasts",
    explanation:
      "Gene therapy refers to a group of techniques by which gene structure or expression is altered to ameliorate a disease. Because of ethical and practical difficulties, germ-line therapy involving alterations of genes in primordial germ cells is not being explored in humans. Although germ-line genetic engineering is being performed in animals with the goals of improved breeding or agricultural yield, it alters the characteristics of offspring rather than the treated individuals. Somatic cell gene therapy is targeted to an affected tissue or group of tissues in the individual, and is most effective if stem cells such as bone marrow can be treated. Somatic cell gene therapy offers the hope of replacing damaged tis- sue without the rejection problems of transplantation. For autosomal reces- sive disorders, only one of the two defective alleles must be replaced or supplemented.",

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "A recombinant vector expresses antisense nucleotides that will hybridize with the targeted mRNA",
      "A recombinant vector replaces inessential viral genes with a functional human gene",
      "A recombinant vector transfects patient cells, which are returned to the patient",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "A recombinant vector contains complementary DNA sequences that will facili- tate site-specific recombination",
    explanation:
      "Challenges for gene therapy include the construction of recombinant viral genomes that can propagate the replace- ment gene (gene constructs or vectors), delivery of the altered gene to the appropriate tissues (gene targeting), and recombination at the appropriate locus so that replacement of the defective gene is achieved (site-specific recombination). The latter step positions DNA sequences in the vector so that the replacement gene pairs and recombines precisely with homolo- gous DNA in the native gene. Ex vivo transfection (introduction of vector DNA into patient cells outside the body) is an ideal method for gene tar- geting if the engineered cells can repopulate the tissue/organ in question. Transfection of bone marrow stem cells with a functional adenosine de- aminase gene, followed by bone marrow transplantation back to the patient, has been successful in restoring immunity to children with severe deficiency. Even when tissue targeting and precise gene replacement are feasible, mimicking the appropriate patterns of gene expression can be a substantial barrier to gene therapy. Injection of deficient enzymes into serum (enzyme therapy) has been successful in disorders such as Gaucher’s disease [231000 (storage of lipids in the spleen and bone)], and takes advantage of cellular pathways that target enzymes to lysosomes.",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detects one-half normal amounts of COL2A1 mRNA in affected individuals",
    explanation:
      "After the locus responsible for a genetic dis- ease is mapped to a particular chromosome region, “candidate” genes can be examined for molecular abnormalities in affected individuals. The con- nective tissue abnormalities in Stickler syndrome (108300) make the COL2A1 collagen locus an attractive candidate for disease mutations, prompting analysis of COL2A1 gene structure and expression. Western blotting detects gene alterations that interfere with protein expression, while use of the reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detects alterations in mRNA levels. Each analysis should detect one-half the respective amounts of COL2A1 protein or mRNA in the case of a pro- moter mutation that abolishes transcription of one COL2A1 allele. South- ern blotting detects nucleotide changes that alter DNA restriction sites, but this is relatively insensitive unless large portions of the gene are deleted. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using DNA probes from the COL2A1 locus is a sensitive method for detecting deletions of the entire locus, and DNA sequencing of the entire gene provides the gold standard for detecting any alteration in the regulatory or coding sequences. Nucleotide sequence changes are still subject to interpretation, since they may represent polymorphisms that do not alter gene function. Population studies and/or in vitro studies of gene expression are often needed to dis- criminate DNA polymorphisms from mutations that disrupt gene function. For any autosomal locus, the interpretation of molecular analyses is com- plicated by the presence of two homologous copies of the gene.",

    correctAnswer: "Missense mutation",
    explanation:
      "Missense mutations, which cause the substi- tution of one amino acid for another, may significantly alter the function of the resultant protein without altering the size of DNA restriction fragments detected by Southern blotting. In this case, northern blot results would most likely also be normal. Single-base changes may also result in nonsense mutations. Large insertions or deletions in the exon or coding regions of the gene alter the Southern blot pattern and usually ablate the activity of one gene copy. In the case of an autosomal locus like that for ornithine aminotransferase, the homologous allele remains active and gives 50% enzyme activity (heterozygote or carrier range with a normal phenotype). Similar effects on enzyme activity would be predicted from complete gene deletions at one locus, while a duplication might produce 150% or 50% of normal enzyme activity depending on the status of promoter sites.",

    correctAnswer: "Enzyme assay of red blood cell hemolysate",
    explanation:
      "Red cell hemolysis after drug exposure suggests a red cell enzyme defect, most easily confirmed by enzyme assay to demonstrate deficient activity. A likely diagnosis here is glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (305900), probably the most common genetic disease (it affects 400 million people worldwide). Tropical African and Mediterranean peoples exhibit the highest prevalence because the disease, like sickle cell trait, confers resistance to malaria. DNA analy- sis is available to demonstrate particular alleles, but simple enzyme assay is sufficient for diagnosis. More than 400 types of abnormal G6PD alleles have been described, meaning that most affected individuals are com- pound heterozygotes. The phenotype of jaundice and red blood cell hemolysis with anemia is triggered by a variety of infections and drugs, including a dietary substance in fava beans. Sulfonamide and related antibiotics as well as antimalarial drugs are notorious for inducing hemol- ysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. G6PD deficiency exhibits X-linked recessive inheritance, explaining why male offspring but not the parents become ill when exposed to antimalarials.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Heterologous bone marrow transplant",
    explanation:
      "All of the modes of therapy are theoreti- cally possible, and enzyme therapy (i.e., injection of purified enzyme) has been successful in several lysosomal deficiencies, particularly those in which the central nervous system is not affected [i.e., Gaucher’s disease (231000)]. Unfortunately, antibodies frequently develop to the injected enzyme and limit the term of successful enzyme delivery. Heterologous bone marrow transplant, preferably from a related donor, offers the most realistic and effective therapy since the graft provides a permanent source of enzyme. Bone marrow transplants do have a 10% mortality, however, and the enzyme diffuses poorly into the central nervous system. Somatic gene therapy (i.e., delivery of enzyme to somatic cells via viral vectors or transfected tissue) is now possible; however, targeting of the gene product to appropriate tissues and organelles is still a problem. Transfected autologous bone marrow transplant (i.e., marrow from the patient) has been used in a few cases of adenosine deaminase deficiency, an immune disorder affecting lymphocytes. Germ-line gene therapy requires the insertion of functional genes into gametes or blastomeres of early embryos prior to birth. The potential for embryonic damage, lack of knowledge regarding developmental gene control, and ethical controversies regarding selective breeding or embryo experimentation make germ-line therapy unrealistic at present.",

    correctAnswer: "Silent",
    explanation:
      "The replacement of the codon UAG with UAA would be a silent mutation since both codons are “stop” signals. Thus, transcription would cease when either triplet was reached. There are three termination codons in mRNA: UAG, UAA, and UGA. These are the only codons that do not specify an amino acid. A missense or a substitution mutation is the converting of a codon specifying one amino acid to another codon specifying a different amino acid. A nonsense mutation converts an amino acid codon to a termination codon. A suppression counteracts the effects of another mutation at another codon. The addition or deletion of nucleotides results in a frame-shift mutation.",

The insertion of an extra base pair or the deletion of one or more base pairs falls into this category. Transitions and transversions are not frame-shift muta- tions; they are substitutions of one base pair for another. Substitutions are the most common type of mutation. In transitions, a purine is replaced by a purine or a pyrimidine by a pyrimidine. In transversions, a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine or vice versa. It has been suggested that transi- tions occur spontaneously owing to the tautomeric changes in base- hydrogen-bond locations. Transversions can be caused by defective DNA polymerases.",

While many different types of mutations can cause thalassemias, mRNA produc- tion or processing is commonly affected. Premature termination of mRNA transcription leading to shorter-than-normal chains, frame-shift mutations leading to abnormal amino acid sequences in chains after the mutation (addition or deletion), and aberrant splicing are some of the RNA problems that can lead to dysfunctional or nonfunctional chains.

    explanation:
      "The structures of glycine and alanine are quite similar, with the −H side group of glycine being replaced with the −CH3 side group of alanine. Consequently, a mutation causing such a change is unlikely to produce a dysfunctional protein. In contrast, a mutation chang- ing a splice site could result in either the abnormal exclusion of an exon or the inclusion of an intron in a protein, which would drastically change its properties. Likewise, frame-shift mutations caused by deletion or addition of one or two bases completely distort the remainder of the protein. The closer a frame shift is to the amino terminal that is synthesized first, the more garbled the protein. All nonsense mutations involve inserting a stop codon in place of whatever amino acid would have been coded. In the case given, only half the protein would be synthesized.",

The cAMP-CAP complex binds to the promoters of several responsive operons at catabolite activator protein (CAP) binding sites, greatly enhancing transcription of operon RNA.

    explanation:
      "The lactose (lac) operon is a classic model for understanding gene regulation. It is negatively controlled through two regulatory genes—the lac I gene that constitutively (always) expresses a repressor protein and the operator (o) region to which the repressor binds. The lac operon is inducible by lactose and lactose analogues, inactivating the repressor and uncovering the operon and its neighboring promoter (p) sequence. RNA polymerase then transcribes the inducible, structural genes β-galactosidase (z), permease (y), and transacetylase (a). The RNA transcript is polycistronic, so that one regulatory site allows transcription of all three genes needed for the metabolism of lactose. The bacterial ribo- somes immediately attach to the nascent RNA transcript, allowing for simultaneous transcription and translation. When all the lactose is metab- olized, the repressor returns to its native conformation, binds to the oper- ator, and shuts down lac operon transcription (see the figure below).",

Cis regulatory elements like the lac operator and promoter or mammalian enhancers are usually DNA sequences (regula- tory sequences) adjoining or within the regulated gene. Trans regulatory ele- ments like the lac repressor protein or mammalian transcription factors are usually diffusible proteins (regulatory factors) that can interact with adjoin- ing target genes or with target genes on other chromosomes. Classification of bacterial elements as cis or trans requires mating experiments where portions of a second chromosome are introduced by transfection (with bacteriophage) or conjugation (with other bacteria).

Unlike the polycistronic mRNA of the bacterial lactose operon, mammalian cells generate several mRNAs or proteins from the same gene by variable protein processing or by alternative splicing. Variable protein processing preserves the peptide products of some gene regions but degrades those from others. Alternative splicing would often produce pro- teins composed of different exon combinations with the same terminal exon and carboxy-terminal peptide, but could remove the terminal exon in some proteins and produce different C-terminal peptides.

During B cell maturation, DNA rearrangements produce light chains with unique V-J segments and heavy chains with unique V-D-J segments. After activation, B cells can change their preferred DNA recombination to join the V-D-J segment to a different constant (C) segment. Different constant region exons are clustered down- stream of the Cμ exon used for initial IgM synthesis by the activated B cell. Recombination at designated switch sites places another constant chain exon (e.g., Cγ for IgG) next to the V-D-J segment and allows the activated B cell to secrete a different antibody isotype (heavy chain class switching). Alternative splicing allows activated B cells to switch from membrane- bound to secreted IgM.",

    question:
      "Two boys with mental disability are found to have mutations in a gene on the X chromosome that has no homology with globin genes. Both are also noted to have deficiency of α-globin synthesis with α thalassemia. Which of the following is the best explanation for their phenotype?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "The mutation disrupted an enhancer for an α-globin pseudogene",

      "There is a second mutation that disrupts an enhancer near the α-globin gene",
      "There is a DNA rearrangement that joins the mutated X chromosome gene with an α-globin gene",
      "There is a second mutation that disrupts the promoter of an α-globin gene",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "The mutation disrupted an X-encoded transcription factor that regulates the α-globin loci",
    explanation:
      "The boys have an X-linked recessive condi- tion called α thalassemia/mental retardation or ATR-X syndrome (309510). The X-encoded gene has an unknown function in brain as well as being a factor that regulates α-globin gene transcription. In order to affect all four α-globin genes, the X-encoded gene must produce a trans-acting factor; second mutations altering enhancers or promoters would be cis-acting and affect only one α-globin gene. Pseudogenes are functionless gene copies, so altered expression would not influence α-globin chain synthesis.",

    question:
      "A middle-aged man presents with a markedly enlarged tonsil and recurrent infections with serum immunoglobulin deficiency. Chromosome analysis demonstrates a translocation between the immunuglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and an unidentified gene on chromosome 8. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his phenotype?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "The translocation has deleted constant chain exons on chromosome 14 and prevented heavy chain class switching",
      "The translocation has deleted the interval containing diversity (D) and joining (J) regions",

      "The translocation has deleted the heavy chain constant chain Cμ so that virgin B cells cannot produce IgM on their membranes",
      "The translocation has deleted an immunoglobulin transcription factor gene on chromosome 8",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "The translocation has activated a tumor-promoting gene on chromosome 8",
    explanation:
      "This case is an example of Burkitt’s lym- phoma, which may affect the tonsils or other lymphoid tissues. The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would pertain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal domi- nant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype. Mutations of cis-acting events must disrupt both homologous loci to produce phenotypes, making them autosomal recessive at the genetic level.",
