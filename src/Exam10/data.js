    question:
      "A 45-year-old woman is being examined as a candidate for cosmetic breast surgery. The surgeon notes that both of her breasts sag considerably. Which structure(s) has most likely become stretched to result in this condition?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Scarpa’s fascia",
      "Pectoralis major muscle",
      "Pectoralis minor muscle",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Suspensory (Cooper’s) ligaments",
    explanation:
      "The suspensory ligaments of the breast, also known as Cooper’s ligaments, are fibrous bands that run from the dermis of the skin to the deep layer of superficial fascia and are primary supports for the breasts against gravity. Ptosis of the breast is usually due to the stretching of these ligaments and can be repaired with plastic surgery. Scarpa’s fascia is the deep membranous layer of superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. The pectoralis major and pectoralis minor are muscles that move the upper limb and lie deep to the breast but do not provide any direct support structure to the breast. The serratus anterior muscle is involved in the movements of the scapula.",

      "A 27-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department after an automobile collision in which he suffered a fracture of the lateral border of the scapula. Six weeks after the accident, physical examination reveals weakness in medial rotation and adduction of the humerus. Which nerve was most likely injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Axillary", "Radial", "Spinal accessory"],
    correctAnswer: "Lower subscapular",
    explanation:
      "The lower subscapular nerve arises from the cervical spinal nerves 5 and 6. It innervates the subscapularis and teres major muscles. The subscapularis and teres major muscles are both responsible for adducting and medially rotating the arm. A lesion of this nerve would result in weakness in these motions. The axillary nerve also arises from cervical spinal nerves 5 and 6 and innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. The deltoid muscle is large and covers the entire surface of the shoulder, and contributes to arm movement in any plane. The teres minor muscle is a lateral rotator and a member of the rotator cuff group of muscles. The radial nerve arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It is the largest branch, and it innervates the triceps brachii and anconeus muscles in the arm. The spinal accessory nerve is cranial nerve XI, and innervates the trapezius muscle, which elevates and depresses the scapula. The ulnar nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus and runs down the medial aspect of the arm. It innervates muscles of the forearm and hand.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Lower subscapular", "Axillary", "Spinal accessory"],
    correctAnswer: "Thenar",
    explanation:
      "The thenar muscles (and lumbricals I and II) are innervated by the median nerve, which runs through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is formed anteriorly by the flexor retinaculum and posteriorly by the carpal bones. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by a compression of the median nerve, due to reduced space in the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel contains the tendons of flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles and their synovial sheaths.

    explanation:
      "Fracture of the medial epicondyle often causes damage to the ulnar nerve due to its position in the groove behind the epicondyle. The ulnar nerve innervates one and a half muscles in the forearm, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus muscles. The nerve continues on to innervate most of the muscles in the hand. The flexor digitorum superficialis is innervated by the median nerve and the biceps brachii muscle by the musculocutaneous.

    explanation:
      "A midshaft humeral fracture can result in injury to the radial nerve and deep brachial artery because they lie in the spiral groove located in the midshaft. Injury to the median nerve and brachial artery can be caused by a supracondylar fracture that occurs by falling on an outstretched hand and partially flexed elbow. A fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus can injure the axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery. The suprascapular artery and nerve can be injured in a shoulder dislocation.

    incorrectAnswers: ["Axillary", "Musculocutaneous", "Radial"],
    correctAnswer: "Median",
    explanation:
      "A supracondylar fracture often results in injury to the median nerve. The course of the median nerve is anterolateral, and at the elbow it lies medial to the brachial artery on the brachialis muscle. The axillary nerve passes posteriorly through the quadrangular space, accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery, and winds around the surgical neck of the humerus. Injury to the surgical neck may damage the axillary nerve. The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and descends between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle. It continues into the forearm as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. The ulnar nerve descends behind the medial epicondyle in its groove and is easily injured and produces “funny bone” symptoms.",

      "A 52-year-old female band director suffered problems in her right arm several days after strenuous field exercises for a major athletic tournament. Examination in the orthopedic clinic reveals wrist drop and weakness of grasp but normal extension of the elbow joint. There is no loss of sensation in the affected limb. Which nerve was most likely affected?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Ulnar", "Anterior interosseous", "Median"],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior interosseous",
    explanation:
      "The radial nerve descends posteriorly between the long and lateral heads of the triceps brachii muscle and passes inferolaterally on the back of the humerus between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii muscle. It eventually enters the anterior compartment and descends to enter the cubital fossa, where it divides into superficial and deep branches. The deep branch of the radial nerve winds laterally around the radius and runs between the two heads of the supinator muscle and continues as the posterior interosseous nerve, innervating extensor muscles of the forearm. Because this injury does not result in loss of sensation over the skin of the upper limb, it is likely that the superficial branch of the radial nerve is not injured. If the radial nerve were injured very proximally, the woman would not be able to extend her elbow. The branches of the radial nerve to the triceps brachii muscle arise proximal to where the nerve runs in the spiral groove. The anterior interosseous nerve arises from the median nerve and supplies the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus muscles, none of which seem to be injured in this example. Injury to the median nerve causes a characteristic flattening (atrophy) of the thenar eminence.",

Flexion and supination of the forearm are severely weakened. She also has loss of sensation on the lateral surface of the forearm. Which of the following nerves has most likely been injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Radial", "Median", "Lateral cord of brachial plexus"],
    correctAnswer: "Musculocutaneous",
    explanation:
      "The musculocutaneous nerve supplies the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles, which are the flexors of the forearm at the elbow. The musculocutaneous nerve continues as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, which supplies sensation to the lateral side of the forearm (with the forearm in the anatomic position). The biceps brachii muscle is the most powerful supinator muscle. Injury to this nerve would result in weakness of supination and forearm flexion and lateral forearm sensory loss. Injury to the radial nerve would result in weakened extension and a characteristic wrist drop. Injury to the median nerve causes paralysis of flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and other flexors in the forearm and results in a characteristic flattening of the thenar eminence. The lateral cord of the brachial plexus gives origin both to the musculocutaneous and lateral pectoral nerves. There is no indication of pectoral paralysis or weakness. Injury to the lateral cord can result in weakened flexion and supination in the forearm, and weakened adduction and medial rotation of the arm. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm is a branch of the musculocutaneous nerve and does not supply any motor innervation. Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve alone is unusual but can follow penetrating injuries.",

    correctAnswer: " Posterior intercostal",
    explanation:
      "The anterior intercostal arteries are twelve small arteries, two in each of the upper six intercostal spaces at the upper and lower borders. The upper artery lying in each space anastomoses with the posterior intercostal arteries, whereas the lower one usually joins the collateral branch of the posterior intercostal artery. The musculophrenic artery is a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery (also known as the internal mammary artery), and it supplies the pericardium, diaphragm, and muscles of the abdominal wall. It anastomoses with the deep circumflex iliac artery. The superior epigastric artery is the other terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, and it supplies the diaphragm, peritoneum, and the anterior abdominal wall and anastomoses with the inferior epigastric artery. The lateral thoracic artery runs along the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle and supplies the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and serratus anterior.

      " The flexor digitorum profundus muscle is dually innervated by the ulnar nerve to the medial two fingers and the median nerve for the long and index fingers. Because of the superficial course of the ulnar nerve, it is vulnerable to laceration. Such an injury would result in an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth digits because the flexor digitorum profundus muscle is the only muscle that flexes this joint. The flexor digitorum superficialis muscle is innervated by the median nerve only, and the course of this nerve runs too deep to be usually affected by lacerations.

If the opponens pollicis is paralyzed, one cannot oppose the pad of the thumb to the pads of the other digits because this is the only muscle that can oppose the thumb by moving the first metacarpal on the trapezium.

Which of the following ligaments is most likely directly associated with this injury?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Joint capsular", "Interosseous", "Radial collateral"],
    correctAnswer: "Anular",
    explanation:
      "The anular ligament is a fibrous band that encircles the head of the radius, forming a collar that fuses with the radial collateral ligament and articular capsule of the elbow. The anular ligament functions to prevent displacement of the head of the radius from its socket. In a child of this age the head of the radius is almost the same diameter as the shaft of the bone, so the head is relatively easy to dislocate. The joint capsule functions to allow free rotation of the joint and does not function in its stabilization. The interosseous membrane is a fibrous layer between the radius and ulna helping to hold these two bones together. The radial collateral ligament extends from the lateral epicondyle to the margins of the radial notch of the ulnar and the anular ligament of the radius. The ulnar collateral ligament is triangular ligament and extends from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon of the ulna (GAS Figs. 7-73A and 7-72).",

The coracobrachialis muscle, which runs from the coracoid process to the humerus, functions in adduction and flexion of the arm. The main function of the triceps brachii muscle is to extend the elbow, and damage to its long head would not affect abduction.

Because this ligament is very strong, it will rarely be damaged; instead, the ligament can cause inflammation or erosion of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle as the tendon passes back and forth under the ligament. The acromioclavicular ligament, connecting the acromion with the lateral end of the clavicle, is not in contact with the supraspinatus tendon. The coracohumeral ligament is located too far anteriorly to impinge upon the supraspinatus tendon.

    correctAnswer: "Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel",
    explanation:
      "The median nerve supplies sensory innervation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers and also to the lateral half of the ring finger. The median nerve also provides motor innervation to muscles of the thenar eminence. Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel explains these deficits in conjunction with normal functioning of the flexor compartment of the forearm because these muscles are innervated by the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel. Also, sensory innervation in the proximal palm will be normal because the palmar branch of the radial nerve usually branches off proximal to the flexor retinaculum. The ulnar nerve is not implicated in these symptoms. It does not provide sensation to digits 1 to 3. Compression of the brachial plexus could not be attributed to pressure from the triceps brachii because this muscle is located distal to the plexus. In addition, brachial plexus symptoms would include other upper limb deficits, rather than the focal symptoms described in this case. Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine would also lead to increasing complexity of symptoms.",

Physical examination reveals several cuts and bruises. He is unable to extend the left wrist, fingers, and thumb, although he can extend the elbow. Sensation is lost in the lateral half of the dorsum of the left hand. Which of the following nerves has most likely been injured to result in these signs, and in what part of the arm is the injury located?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Median nerve, anterior wrist",
      "Median nerve, arm",
      "Ulnar nerve, midlateral forearm",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Radial nerve, midhumerus",
    explanation:
      "The radial nerve innervates the extensor compartments of the arm and the forearm. It supplies the triceps brachii proximal to the spiral groove, so elbow extension is intact here. It also provides sensory innervation to much of the posterior arm and forearm as well as the dorsal thumb, index, and middle fingers up to the level of the fingernails. Symptoms are described only in the distal limb due to the midhumeral location of the lesion. The median nerve innervates flexors of the forearm and thenar muscles and provides sensory innervation to the lateral palmar hand. The ulnar nerve supplies only the flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus in the forearm. Additionally, its sensory distribution is to both the palmar and dorsal aspects of the medial hand. It does not supply extensor muscles.",

Examination in the emergency department indicates that a nerve has been severed. Which of the following conditions will also most likely be seen during physical examination?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Inability to adduct and abduct his fingers",
      "Inability to flex his fingers",
      "Inability to flex his thumb",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sensory loss over the lateral surface of his forearm",
    explanation:
      "The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the brachialis and biceps brachii muscles, which are the main flexors at the elbow. The biceps brachii inserts on the radius and is an important supinator. Because the musculocutaneous nerve is damaged in this case, it leads to loss of sensory perception to the lateral forearm, which is supplied by the distal continuation of the musculocutaneous nerve (known as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve). The name “musculocutaneuous” indicates it is “muscular” in the arm and “cutaneous” in the forearm. Adduction and abduction of the fingers are mediated by the ulnar nerve and would not be affected in this instance. The flexor pollicis brevis muscle flexes the thumb and is mainly innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. Flexion of the fingers is performed by the long flexors of the fingers and lumbrical muscles, innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. Sensory innervation of the medial forearm is provided by the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, usually a direct branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus.",

    correctAnswer: "Compression of the deep radial nerve by the supinator",
    explanation:
      "E. The deep branch of the radial nerve courses between the two heads of the supinator muscle and is located just medial and distal to the lateral epicondyle. After the nerve emerges from the supinator it is called the posterior interosseous nerve. It can be irritated by hypertrophy of the supinator, which compresses the nerve, causing pain and weakness. The ulnar nerve courses laterally behind the medial epicondyle and continues anterior to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The median nerve passes into the forearm flexor compartment; the superficial radial nerve courses down the lateral aspect of the posterior forearm and would not cause pain due to pressure applied to the posterior forearm.",

    correctAnswer:
      "The insertion of the tendon of the extensor digitorum onto the base of the distal phalanx",
    explanation:
      "The contraction of the extensor mechanism produces extension of the distal interphalangeal joint. When it is torn from the distal phalanx, the digit is pulled into flexion by the flexor digitorum profundus muscle. If a piece of the distal phalanx is attached to the torn tendon it is an avulsion fracture. The proper palmar digital branches of the median nerve supply lumbrical muscles and carry sensation from their respective digits. Vincula longa are slender, bandlike connections from the deep flexor tendons to the phalanx that can carry blood supply to the tendons. The insertions of the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus are on the flexor surface of the middle and distal phalanges, respectively, and act to flex the interphalangeal joints.",

    correctAnswer: "Radial nerve",
    explanation:
      "The radial nerve is the most likely nerve compressed to cause these symptoms. This type of nerve palsy is often called “Saturday night palsy.” One reason for this nickname is that people would supposedly fall asleep after being intoxicated on a Saturday night with their arm over the back of a chair or bench, thereby compressing the nerve in the spiral groove. The radial nerve innervates all of the extensors of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. It innervates the triceps brachii muscle but the motor branch typically comes off proximal to the site of compression, so the patient can still extend the elbow. Paralysis of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus would result in loss of the musculocutaneous nerve and the pectoral nerves, which do not mediate extension of the forearm or hand. The medial cord of the brachial plexus branches into the median nerve and ulnar nerve. Neither of these nerves innervates muscles that control extension. The median nerve innervates flexors of the forearm and the thenar muscles. The lateral and median pectoral nerves do not extend into the arm and innervate the pectoralis major and minor muscles.",

    explanation:
      "The patient exhibits the classic “benediction attitude” of the thumb and fingers from injury to the median nerve proximally in the forearm. The thumb is somewhat extended (radial supplied abductor and extensors unopposed); digits 2 and 3 are extended (by intact interossei); digits 4 and 5 are partially flexed (by their intact flexor digitorum profundus). A lesion of the median nerve would result in weakened flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of all digits (flexor digitorum superficialis muscle), loss of flexion of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, the distal interphalangeal joints of digits 2 and 3 (flexor digitorum profundus muscle), and weakened flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second and third digits (first and second lumbricals). A lesion of both the ulnar and median nerves would cause weakness or paralysis of flexion of all of the digits. A lesion of the ulnar nerve would mostly cause weakness in flexion of the DIP of the fourth and fifth digits and would affect all of the interosseous muscles and the lumbricals of the third and fourth digits.

Abduction of the humerus between 15 degrees and the horizontal is performed by the deltoid muscle. Lateral rotation of the humerus is mainly performed by the deltoid muscle, teres minor, and the infraspinatus. The deltoid and teres minor are both lost in this case. Fracture of the glenoid fossa would lead to drooping of the shoulder. Fracture of the anatomic neck of the humerus will similarly lead to a drooping of the shoulder but would not necessarily affect abduction of the humerus. It is also quite unusual.

      "The subclavian vein traverses between the clavicle and first rib and is the most superficial structure to be damaged following a fracture of the clavicle. The subclavian artery runs posterior to the subclavian vein, and though it is in the appropriate location, it would likely not be damaged because of its deep anatomic position. The cephalic vein is a tributary to the axillary vein after ascending on the lateral side of the arm. Its location within the body is too superficial and lateral to the site of injury. The lateral thoracic artery is a branch from the axillary artery that runs lateral to the pectoralis minor.

Which of the following is the most likely fracture involved in this case?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Scaphoid fracture",
      "Bennett’s fracture",
      "Volkmann’s ischemic contracture",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Colles’ fracture",
    explanation:
      "A. A Colles’ fracture is a fracture of the distal end of the radius. The proximal portion of the radius is displaced anteriorly, with the distal bone fragment projecting posteriorly. The displacement of the radius from the wrist often gives the appearance of a dinner fork, thus a Colles’ fracture is often referred to as a “dinner fork” deformity. A scaphoid fracture results from a fracture of the scaphoid bone and would thus not cause displacement of the radius. This fracture usually occurs at the narrow aspect (“waist”) of the scaphoid bone. Bennett’s and boxer’s fractures both result from fractures of the metacarpals (first and fifth, respectively). Volkmann’s ischemic contracture is a muscular deformity that can follow a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, with arterial laceration into the flexor compartment of the forearm. Ischemia and muscle contracture, with extreme pain, accompany this fracture.",

    correctAnswer:
      "Partial or complete tearing of the coracoclavicular ligament",
    explanation:
      "In shoulder separation, either or both the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments can be partially or completely torn through. The acromioclavicular joint can be interrupted and the distal end of the clavicle may deviate upward in a complete separation, while the upper limb droops away inferiorly causing a “step off” that can be palpated and sometimes observed. Displacement of the head of the humerus is shoulder dislocation, not separation. The coracoacromial ligament is not torn in separation (but it is sometimes used in the repair of the torn coracoclavicular ligament). Disruption of the glenoid labrum often accompanies shoulder dislocation.",

      "The nail was fired explosively from the nail gun and then pierced the ulnar nerve near the coronoid process of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus. Paralysis of the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle would result (among other significant deficits), with loss of flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints of digits 4 and 5. Ulnar trauma at the wrist would not affect the interphalangeal joints, although it would cause paralysis of interossei, hypothenar muscles, and so on. Median nerve damage proximal to the pronator teres would affect proximal interphalangeal joint flexion and distal interphalangeal joint flexion of digits 2 and 3 as well as thumb flexion.

    correctAnswer:
      "Posterior circumflex humeral artery with deep brachial artery",
    explanation:
      "The injury has occurred just beyond the third part of the axillary artery. The only collateral arterial channel between the third part of the axillary artery and the brachial artery is between the posterior circumflex humeral and the ascending branch of the profunda brachii, and this anastomotic path is often inadequate to supply the arterial needs of the limb. The posterior circumflex humeral arises from the third part of the axillary artery. It typically anastomoses with a variably small, ascending branch of the profunda brachii branch of the brachial artery. The suprascapular artery anastomoses with the circumflex scapular deep to the infraspinatus. The dorsal scapular artery (passing beneath the medial border of the scapula) has no anastomosis with thoracodorsal within the scope of the injury. The lateral thoracic artery has no anastomoses with the brachial artery. The supreme thoracic artery (from first part of axillary) has no helpful anastomoses with the thoracoacromial (second part of axillary) (GAS Figs. 7-39 and 7-50).",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Median", "Posterior interosseous", "Radial"],
    correctAnswer: "Anterior interosseous",

      "The anterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the median nerve that supplies the flexor pollicis longus, the lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus, and the pronator quadratus muscles. If it is injured, flexion of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb will be compromised. The median nerve gives rise to the anterior interosseous nerve but is not a direct enough answer as injury to it would result in more widespread effects. The posterior interosseous nerve supplies extensors in the forearm, not flexors. The radial nerve gives rise to the posterior interosseous nerve and is not associated with the anterior interosseous nerve; therefore, it would not have any effect on the flexors of the forearm. The recurrent median nerve is also a branch of the median nerve but supplies the thenar eminence muscles, and its injury would result in problems with opposable motion of the thumb (GAS Fig. 7-87).",

This is the more common type of “boxer’s fracture.” Neither a fracture of the ulnar styloid nor a Colles’ fracture nor Smith’s fracture of the distal radius would present with the absence of a knuckle as observed here. Bennett’s fracture involves dislocation of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.

    correctAnswer: "T1 ventral ramus",
    explanation:
      "Scoliosis (severe lateral curvature of the spine) in the patient is causing compression or stretching of the T1 spinal nerve ramus by the first rib as the nerve ascends to join C8 and form the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. T1 provides sensation for the medial side of the forearm, via the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. T1 is the principal source of motor supply to all of the intrinsic muscles in the palm. Its dysfunction affects all fine motor movements of the digits. Long flexors of the fingers are intact; therefore, the median nerve and ulnar nerve are not injured. The extensors of the wrist are functional; therefore, the radial nerve is not paralyzed. The only sensory disturbance is that of the T1 dermatome.",

      "Interestingly, “gamekeeper’s thumb” was a term coined because this injury was most commonly associated with Scottish gamekeepers who, it is said, killed small animals such as rabbits by breaking their necks between the ground and the gamekeeper’s thumb and index finger. The resulting valgus force on the abducted metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint caused injury to the ulnar collateral ligament. These days this injury is more commonly seen in skiers who land awkwardly with their hand braced on a ski pole, causing the valgus force on the thumb as is seen in this patient.

    explanation:
      "C. The axillary nerve passes dorsally around the surgical neck of the humerus (accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery) and can be injured when the humerus is fractured at that location. The axillary nerve provides sensation to the skin over the upper, lateral aspect of the shoulder. Therefore, although the patient might not be able to abduct the arm because of the injury, a simple test of skin sensation can indicate whether there is associated nerve injury of the axillary nerve (CN XI). Shrugging the shoulders can help assess trapezius function, thereby testing the spinal accessory nerve. Intact sensation of the skin on the medial aspect of the axilla and arm is an indication that the radial and intercostobrachial nerves are functional. Pushing against an immovable object tests the serratus anterior muscle and the long thoracic nerve.",

Because function of the left extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis tendons was lost, it was decided to replace those tendons with the palmaris longus tendons from both forearms because of their convenient location and relative unimportance.

      "Lower plexus (lower trunk) trauma",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "The palmaris longus was absent bilaterally; the nerve normally beneath it looked like a tendon and was cut",
    explanation:
      "The surgeon took the distal segments of the median nerves from both forearms, mistakenly believing them to be palmaris longus tendons. Both of the structures lie in the midline of the ventral surface of the distal forearm and are often of similar appearance in color and diameter. The nerve is located deep to the tendon, when the tendon is present, but when the tendon is absent, the nerve appears to be where the tendon belongs. There is no evidence of rib fractures; even so, a fractured rib would not explain loss of sensation on the lateral portion of the palm. Lower plexus trauma (C8, T1) would result in paralysis of forearm flexor muscles and all intrinsic hand muscles and sensory loss over the medial dorsum of the hand, in addition to palmar sensory loss. Dupuytren’s contracture is a flexion contracture of (usually) digits four and five from connective tissue disease in the palm. Radial nerve injury in the posterior forearm would affect metacarpophalangeal joint extension, thumb extension, and so on, not palmar disturbances.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "The median and ulnar nerves are damaged at the wrist.",
    explanation:
      "Trauma both to the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist results in total clawing of the fingers. The metacarpophalangeal joints of all digits are extended by the unopposed extensors because the radial nerve is intact. All interossei and lumbricals are paralyzed because the deep branch of the ulnar nerve supplies all of the interossei; lumbricals I and II are paralyzed, for they are innervated by the median nerve; lumbricals III and IV are paralyzed, for they receive supply from the deep ulnar nerve. The interossei and lumbricals are responsible for extension of the interphalangeal joints. When they are paralyzed, the long flexor tendons pull the fingers into a position of flexion, completing the “claw” appearance. If the median nerve were intact, the clawing would be less noticeable in the index and long fingers because the two lumbricals would still be capable of some degree of extension of those interphalangeal joints. If the median nerve alone is injured in the carpal tunnel, there would be loss of thenar opposition but not clawing. If the median and ulnar nerves are both transected at the elbow, the hand appears totally flat because of the loss of long flexors, in addition to intrinsic paralysis.",

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Claw hand deformity",
      "Boutonnière deformity",
      "Swan-neck deformity",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Mallet finger",
    explanation:
      "The extensor tendons of the fingers insert distally on the distal phalanx of each digit. If the tendon is avulsed, or the proximal part of the distal phalanx is detached, the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) is pulled into total flexion by the unopposed flexor digitorum profundus muscle. This result gives the digit the appearance of a mallet. In boutonnière deformity, the central portion of the extensor tendon expansion is torn over the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, allowing the tendon to move palmarward, causing the tendon to act as a flexor of the PIP joint. This causes the DIP joint to be hyperextended. Swanneck deformity involves slight flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, hyperextension of PIP joints, and slight flexion of DIP joints. This condition results most often from shortening of the tendons of intrinsic muscles, as in rheumatoid arthritis. Dupuytren’s contracture results from connective tissue disorder in the palm, usually causing irreversible flexion of digits 4 and 5. Claw hand occurs with lesions to the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist. In this clinical problem all intrinsic muscles are paralyzed, including the extensors of the interphalangeal joints. The MCP joint extensors, supplied by the radial nerve, and the long flexors of the fingers, supplied more proximally in the forearm by the median and ulnar nerves, are intact and are unopposed, pulling the fingers into the “claw” appearance.",

The flexor pollicis longus would not be paralyzed if the median nerve were injured at the wrist. Lateral palm sensory loss confirms median nerve injury. If only the anterior interosseous nerve were damaged, there would be no cutaneous sensory deficit.

The remainder of the lateral pectoral nerve joins the medial pectoral nerve in a neural arch that provides motor supply to the remaining parts of the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor. Physical examination reveals no obvious motor or sensory deficits. Loss of the medial pectoral nerve would have no effect on the clavicular head of pectoralis major and might not be discernible.

    correctAnswer: "Supracondylar line of humerus",
    explanation:
      "A fracture of the humerus just proximal to the epicondyles is called a supracondylar fracture. This is the most common cause of a Volkmann ischemic fracture. The sharp bony fragment often lacerates the brachial (or other) artery, with bleeding into the flexor compartment. Diminution of arterial supply to the compartment results in the ischemia. Bleeding into the compartment causes greatly increased pressure, first blocking venous outflow from the compartment, then reducing the arterial flow into the compartment as the pressure rises to arterial levels. The ischemic muscles then undergo unrelieved contracture. A humeral fracture is sometimes placed in a cast from shoulder to wrist, often concealing the ischemia until major tissue loss occurs. Cold, insensate digits, and great pain are warnings of this compartmental syndrome, demanding that the cast be removed and the compartment opened (“released”) for pressure reduction and vascular repair. Fracture of the surgical neck endangers the axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery, although not ischemic contracture. Fracture of the humerus in the spiral groove can injure the radial nerve and profunda brachii artery. Fracture of the olecranon does not result in Volkmann’s contracture, although the triceps brachii can displace the distal fractured fragment of the ulna.",

    correctAnswer: "Behind the medial epicondyle",
    explanation:
      "The force of the woman’s fall on the outstretched hand was transmitted up through the forearm, in this case resulting in dislocation of the olecranon at the elbow, putting traction on the ulnar nerve as it passes around the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Ulnar trauma at the elbow can cause weakness in medial flexion (adduction) at the wrist, from loss of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulnar nerve injury also results in sensory loss in the medial hand and paralysis of the interossei and medial two lumbricals, with clawing especially of digits 4 and 5. Injury of the ulnar nerve at the pisiform bone would not affect the flexor carpi ulnaris, nor would it produce sensory loss on the dorsum of the hand because the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar branches off proximal to the wrist. Carpal tunnel problems affect median nerve function, which is not indicated here. The ulnar nerve passes medial to the cubital fossa between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, not between the heads of the flexor digitorum superficialis.

      "The interossei are the most important muscles in extension of the interphalangeal (IP) joints because of the manner of their insertion into the extensor expansion of the fingers, which passes dorsal to the transverse axes of these joints. The lumbrical muscles assist in IP extension, in addition to flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulnar nerve injury at the wrist results in paralysis of all the interossei and the medial two lumbricals. Extensors of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are innervated by the deep radial nerve. Unopposed extension of the MCP joints causes them to be held in extension whereas unopposed long flexors of the fingers (supplied by median and ulnar nerves proximally in the forearm) cause them to be flexed into the “claw” position. The lumbricals of digits two and three are still intact because they are supplied by the median nerve, so clawing is not seen as much on these digits.

    question:
      "Several weeks after surgical dissection of her left axilla for the removal of lymph nodes for staging and treatment of her breast cancer, a 32-year-old woman was told by her general physician that she had “winging” of her left scapula when she pushed against resistance during her physical examination. She told the physician that she had also experienced difficulty lately in raising her left arm above her head when she was combing her hair. In a subsequent consult visit with her surgeon, she was told that a nerve was accidentally injured during the diagnostic surgical procedure and that this produced her scapular abnormality and inability to raise her arm normally. What was the origin of this nerve?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "The upper trunk of her brachial plexus",
      "The posterior division of the middle trunk",
      "The posterior cord of the brachial plexus",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Ventral rami of the brachial plexus",
    explanation:
      "The long thoracic nerve was injured during the axillary dissection, resulting in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle. The serratus anterior is important in rotation of the scapula in raising the arm above the level of the shoulder. Its loss results in protrusion of the medial border (“winging” of the scapula), which is more obvious when one pushes against resistance. The long thoracic nerve arises from the ventral rami of C5, C6, and C7. The upper trunk (C5, C6) supplies rotator and abductor muscles of the shoulder and elbow flexors. The posterior division of the middle trunk contains C7 fibers for distribution to extensor muscles; likewise, the posterior cord supplies extensors of the arm, forearm, and hand. The lateral cord (C5, C6, and C7) gives origin to the lateral pectoral nerve, the musculocutaneous nerve, and the lateral root of the median nerve. There is no sensory loss in the limb in this patient; injury to any of the other nerve elements listed here would be associated with specific dermatome losses.",

      "A 72-year-old man consulted his physician because he had noticed a thickening of the skin at the base of his left ring finger during the preceding 3 months. As he described it, “There appears to be some hard tissue that is pulling my little and ring fingers into my palm.” On examination of the palms of both hands, localized and firm ridges are observed in the palmar skin that extend from the middle part of the palm to the base of the ring and little fingers. What is the medical term for this sign?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Ape hand", "Claw hand", "Wrist drop"],
    correctAnswer: "Dupuytren’s contracture",
    explanation:
      "Dupuytren’s contracture or deformity is a result of fibromatosis of palmar fascia, resulting in irregular thickening of the fascial attachments to the skin, which causes gradual contraction of the digits, especially digits 4 and 5. In 50% of cases, it is bilateral in occurrence. Ape hand, or flat hand, is a result of loss of the median and ulnar nerves at the elbow, with paralysis of all long flexors of the fingers and all intrinsic hand muscles. The term can also be specific for just median nerve injury and a flattened thenar eminence. Claw hand results from paralysis of interphalangeal joint extension by interossei and lumbricals, innervated primarily by the ulnar nerve. Wrist drop occurs with radial nerve paralysis and loss of the extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis. Mallet finger results from detachment of the extensor mechanism from the distal phalanx of a finger and unopposed flexion of that distal interphalangeal joint.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Radial", "Median", "Ulnar"],

    explanation:
      "The axillary nerve is a direct branch of the posterior cord and wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus to innervate the teres minor and the deltoid muscles. With this anatomic arrangement, the axillary nerve is tightly “tethered” to the proximal humerus. When the head of the humerus is dislocated, it often puts traction on the axillary nerve.",

    correctAnswer: "Intertubercular groove",
    explanation:
      "The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscles runs in the intertubercular groove on the proximal humerus as it changes direction and turns medially to attach to the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. This change in direction within an osseous structure predisposes the tendon to wear and tear, particularly in people who overuse the biceps brachii muscle.

      "The supraspinatus muscle inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus and is said to initiate abduction of the arm at the shoulder. It is supplied principally by spinal nerve C5. The subscapularis muscle is the only muscle that inserts on the lesser tubercle. The subscapularis muscle is innervated by the upper and lower subscapular nerves. The teres minor muscle takes origin from the lateral border of the scapula; the teres major muscle takes origin from the region of the inferior angle and the lateral border of the scapula.",

    incorrectAnswers: ["Humerus", "Radius", "Ulna"],
    correctAnswer: "Clavicle",
    explanation:

Often these bones do not fracture but rather pass the compressive forces proximally. The appendicular skeleton joins with the axial skeleton at the sternoclavicular joint. The forces are not sufficiently transferred to the sternum, causing the clavicle to absorb the force, resulting in common pediatric fracture of this sigmoidal-shaped bone.",

Physical examination reveals paraesthesia along the medial surface of the forearm and palm and weakness and atrophy of gripping muscles (“long flexors”) and the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The radial pulse is diminished when her neck is rotated to the ipsilateral side (positive Adson’s test). What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "Erb-Duchenne paralysis",
      "Aneurysm of the brachiocephalic artery, with plexus compression",
      "Carpal tunnel syndrome",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Thoracic outlet syndrome",
    explanation:
      "The patient is suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome, involving neural and vascular elements. This results from any condition that decreases the dimensions of the superior thoracic aperture (the formal name of the thoracic outlet). It could be a result of a cervical rib, accessory muscles, and/or atypical connective tissue bands at the root of the neck. In this case, symptoms involve the arm, forearm, and hand. Paraesthesia along the medial forearm and hand and atrophy of long flexors and intrinsic muscles point to a possible compression or traction problem of the lower trunk (C8, T1) rather than a lesion of either the median or ulnar nerve. The lateral palm has no sensory problem, which tends to rule out median nerve involvement. Changes in the radial artery pulse point to vascular compression. Erb-Duchenne paralysis of the upper trunk would affect proximal limb functions, such as arm rotation, abduction, and so on. This lesion is on the left side, so the brachiocephalic artery could not be involved because it arises from the right side of the aortic arch; moreover, it would not compress the brachial plexus. Carpal tunnel syndrome would not explain the problems of the forearm and medial hand, or the long flexor atrophy. An isolated medial cord lesion would not explain the atrophy of all long flexors and intrinsic muscles and does not explain the radial pulse characteristics. The ischemic pain in the arm is due to vascular compression.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Injury of the ulnar nerve in Guyon’s canal",
    explanation:
      "Striking the concrete blocks with the medial side of her hand has injured the ulnar nerve in Guyon’s canal. This is the triangular tunnel formed by the pisiform bone medially, the flexor retinaculum dorsally, and the deep fascia of the wrist ventrally. This injury would result in loss of sensation to the medial palm and the palmar surface of the medial one and a half digits and motor loss of the hypothenar muscles, the interossei, and the medial two lumbricals. The median nerve is not involved because the thenar muscles and lateral palmar sensations are intact. The dorsal ulnar nerve arises proximal to the wrist, thus it would not be lost. Carpal bone dislocation is unlikely. If the lunate bone were dislocated, it would not cause compression of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. There is no indication of fifth metacarpal fracture, the so-called boxer’s fracture.",

The median nerve also provides motor innervation to muscles of the thenar eminence. Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel explains these deficits in conjunction with normal functioning of the flexor compartment of the forearm. The ulnar nerve is not implicated in these symptoms. Compression of the brachial plexus could not be attributed to pressure from hypertrophy of the triceps brachii muscle, it is located distal to the plexus.

      "A cervical rib (usually found at C7) may cause thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a condition characterized by weak muscle tone in the hand and loss of radial pulse when the upper limb is abducted above the shoulder. The mechanism of injury with the gun being fired overhead suggests a lower trunk injury to the brachial plexus. The axillary artery supplies the shoulder muscles, and there is no loss of function to these muscles. The upper trunk of the brachial plexus also supplies innervation to the shoulder muscles, which are unaffected based on the patient’s presenting abnormalities. The subclavian artery is located anterior to the brachial plexus until the plexus separates into cords as it passes under the clavicle.

    incorrectAnswers: ["Ulnar", "Radial", "Recurrent median"],
    correctAnswer: "Median",
    explanation:
      "The median nerve provides innervation to most of the muscles in the flexor compartment of the forearm; cutaneous innervation of the second, third, and fourth digits and palmar and dorsum aspects of the hand; and innervation of four intrinsic hand muscles: first and second lumbricals, abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and flexor pollicis brevis. The thenar compartment contains the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and flexor pollicis brevis muscles, and these muscles are innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. The patient has weakening of the first two lumbricals and not simply the thenar muscles, so the median nerve is most likely to be compressed. Another indication that the median nerve is compressed is the vigorous shaking of the wrist. Because the median nerve traverses the carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel compression could lead to this action on part of the patient. The ulnar nerve provides innervation for part of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles. These muscles are not weakened in this patient.

      "A 32-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department after a severe car crash. Radiographic examination reveals multiple fractures of his right upper limb. A surgical procedure is performed and metallic plates are attached to various bony fragments to restore the anatomy. Five months postoperatively the patient visits the outpatient clinic. Upon physical examination the patient can abduct his arm and extend the forearm, and the sensation of the forearm and hand is intact; however, hand grasp is very weak, and he cannot extend his wrist against gravity. Which of the following nerves was most likely injured during the surgical procedure?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Posterior cord of the brachial plexus",
      "Radial and ulnar",
      "Radial, ulnar, and median",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Radial nerve at the distal third of the humerus",
    explanation:
      "The patient can extend his forearm, which suggests that the triceps brachii muscle is not weakened. Supination appears to be weak along with hand grasp and wrist drop. This would indicate that part of the radial nerve has been lost below the innervation of the triceps brachii and above the branches to the supinator and extensors in the forearm. However, sensation on the forearm and hand is intact, indicating that the superficial branch of the radial nerve is intact. The superficial branch of the radial nerve separates from the deep radial nerve at the distal third of the humerus. The posterior cord of the brachial plexus is responsible for providing innervation of the axially and radial nerves. This patient does have some radial nerve innervation and no loss of axillary nerve function. The patient does not have weakened adduction of the wrist, indicating that the ulnar nerve is not injured. If both the radial and musculocutaneous nerves are injured, supination would not be possible as the supinator and biceps brachii muscles provide supination of the forearm.",

      "A 52-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department after falling on wet pavement. Radiographic examination reveals fracture of the radius. An MRI study reveals a hematoma between the fractured radius and supinator muscle. Upon physical examination the patient has weakened abduction of the thumb and extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers. Which of the following nerves is most likely affected?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Anterior interosseous",
      "Radial nerve",
      "Deep branch of ulnar nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior interosseous",
    explanation:
      "The posterior interosseous nerve is an extension of the deep branch of the radial nerve after it emerges distal to the supinator. It is responsible for innervation of several muscles in the extensor compartment of the posterior aspect of the forearm, including extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints. The deep radial nerve courses laterally around the radius and passes between the two heads of the supinator muscle and is thus likely to be compressed by a hematoma between the fractured radius and the supinator muscle. Though the radial nerve gives rise to the posterior interosseous nerve, this answer choice is too general and would not indicate the precise injured branch of the radial nerve. Both the deep branch of the ulnar nerve and the median nerve traverse the medial and anteromedial aspect of the arm, respectively. These nerves primarily supply the flexor compartment of the arm. The anterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the median nerve and supplies the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and the pronator quadratus muscles (GAS Fig. 7-90).",

The supraspinatus muscle is the primary muscle involved in abduction of the arm from 0 to 15 degrees. The deltoid muscle, supplied primarily by C5, abducts the arm from 15 to 90 degrees. The middle trunk is just C7 and has nothing to do with the muscle involved in initial abduction of the arm. The inferior trunk is C8-T1 and does not supply the supraspinatus muscle; therefore, it is not the right answer.

    correctAnswer:
      "Separation of the head of the radius from its articulation with the ulna and the capitulum of the humerus",
    explanation:
      "This type of dislocation is common in children and results when the radius is dislocated and slips out from the anular ligament, which holds it in place, articulating with the ulna and the capitulum of the humerus. In adults the anular ligament has a good “grip” at the radial neck, but in young children the radial head is not fully developed, leading to an indistinct neck. Compression of the median nerve is not likely due to its medial position in the cubital fossa. The radius does not articulate with the trochlea of the humerus; the ulna articulates at this position. The ulna is not likely to be dislocated because it is more stable than the radius, which has only the anular ligament for its support. The radial nerve does not pass behind the medial epicondyle; rather, the ulnar nerve does this, so this is not the correct answer.",

Because the patient’s only motor deficit involves the triceps brachii muscles, one can rule out C5 and C6, which supply fibers to the axillary, musculocutaneous, and upper subscapular nerves. Damage to either of these ventral rami would result in additional motor deficits of the shoulder and flexor compartment of the arm. One can also rule out C8-T1 because these ventral rami form the medial pectoral nerve and the medial brachial and antebrachial cutaneous nerves.

    explanation:
      "Injury to the superior trunk of the brachial plexus can damage nerve fibers going to the suprascapular, axillary, and musculocutaneous nerves. Damage to the suprascapular and axillary nerves causes impaired abduction and lateral rotation of the arm. Damage to the musculocutaneous nerve causes impaired flexion of the forearm. A winged scapula would be caused by damage to the long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve is formed from spinal cord levels C5, C6, and C7, so the serratus anterior muscle would be weakened from the damage to C5 and C6, but the muscle would not be completely paralyzed. The intrinsic muscles of the hand are innervated by the ulnar nerve, which would most likely remain intact. Paraesthesia in the medial aspect of the arm would be caused by damage to the medial brachial cutaneous nerve (C8-T1; inferior trunk).

    explanation:
      "The supinator muscle attaches to the radius proximally and when fractured would cause a lateral deviation. The pronator teres muscle originates on the medial epicondyle and coronoid process of the ulna and inserts onto the middle of the lateral side of the radius, pulling the radius medially below the fracture. The pronator quadratus muscle originates on the anterior surface of the distal ulna and inserts on the anterior surface of the distal radius, pulling the radius medially. The brachioradialis muscle originates on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and inserts at the base of the radial styloid process, far below the fracture.

Venous thrombosis would not cause pain but could cause death from a pulmonary embolism if a thrombus (clot) broke free and became lodged in the pulmonary trunk. Thoracic outlet syndrome affects nerves in the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery and blood vessels between the neck and the axilla, far above the cast.

If the the palm does not flush with blood when the radial artery is released, then the ulnar artery is not sufficient to supply the hand if the radial artery is harvested for a graft. The other tests have nothing to do with the patency of the radial artery.",

    correctAnswer: "Injury of the ulnar nerve by a fractured pisiform",
    explanation:
      "The ulnar nerve enters the hand superficial to the flexor retinaculum and lateral to the pisiform bone and innervates all the interossei via the deep branch. These muscles are responsible for adduction and abduction of the fingers. Flexion of the fingers is spared because the flexor digitorum superficialis and most of the flexor digitorum profundus are innervated by the median nerve, which is unaffected by this injury. Had the median nerve been compressed in the carpal tunnel, one would have difficulty with motion of the thumb as a result of a lack of innervation of the thenar muscles.

      "Clavicular fracture",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "Anterior dislocation of the humerus",
    explanation:
      "The glenohumeral joint is an extremely mobile joint with a wide range of movement. Anterior dislocation is the most common. Anterior dislocations of the humerus usually follow injuries where abnormal force is applied to the shoulder while the arm is extended, abducted, and externally rotated. When the head of the humerus is displaced anteriorly and inferiorly, there is flattening of the deltoid prominence (due to the increased weight of the humerus pulling on the muscle), protrusion of the acromion, and anterior axillary fullness (due to the movement of the humeral head into this location). The most commonly injured nerve is the axillary nerve, which innervates the teres minor and deltoid and also provides cutaneous supply to the posterior arm and the skin overlying the deltoid muscle. Acromioclavicular joint subluxation typically results from a blow to the tip of the shoulder when the arm is at the side and slightly adducted. It produces swelling and superior displacement of the clavicle. It is not associated with specific major nerve injuries or sensory deficits. The clavicle is a commonly fractured bone typically after direct trauma. Most fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle. There is local swelling and tenderness but rarely any neurovascular damage. A spiral humerus midshaft fracture may result from a fall on an outstretched hand. The radial nerve is commonly fractured as it runs in the radial groove. Rotator cuff tears usually occur when there is some degenerative injury to the tendons. The rotator cuff is made up of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor and tendons.",

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Biceps brachii tendon",
      "Interosseous membrane",
      "Radial collateral ligament",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Anular ligament",
    explanation:
      "The patient is experiencing radial head subluxation (“nursemaid’s elbow”), the most common elbow injury in children. The injury often results from a sharp pull on the hand while the forearm is pronated and the elbow is extended. The underdevelopment of the radial head and the laxity of the anular ligament allows for the radial head to sublux (partially dislocate) from this cuff of tissue. This condition is extremely painful but can be easily treated with supination and compression of the elbow joint. Although it is uncommon for muscle tendons to rupture, the most common is the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii. It produces a characteristic deformity when flexing the elbow: an extremely prominent bulge of unattached muscle belly called the “Popeye sign.” The interosseous membrane is an expansive sheet of connective tissue that connects the radius and ulna at their midsection. It serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the forearm. The radial collateral ligament lies on the lateral side of the elbow joint reinforcing the radiohumeral joint. The ulnar collateral ligament lies on the medial side of the elbow joint reinforcing the ulnohumeral joint.",

    correctAnswer: "Dislocated shoulder joint",
    explanation:
      "The glenohumeral joint is an extremely mobile joint with a wide range of motion. Anterior dislocation of the humerus is most common and usually associated with an isolated traumatic incident. When the head of the humerus is displaced anteriorly and inferiorly, flattening of the deltoid prominence occurs, leading to loss of the normal contour of the humerus. There is protrusion of the acromion, and the slope of the shoulder lateral to the acromion is depressed and has a “dented” appearance. Avulsion of the coronoid process of the ulna usually occurs with elbow hyperextension, which affects the shoulder joint. A fracture of the midshaft of the humerus damages the radial nerve. Although a fracture to the surgical neck of the humerus and a laceration to the axillary part of the posterior cord affect the axillary nerve, which innervates the deltoid muscle, there will not be any depression beneath the acromion in either case.",

Flexion and opposition of the thumb are performed by muscles innervated by the median nerve and would not be injured, as the median nerve travels deep to the flexor retinaculum.",

      "A 36-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department after an athletic injury that has caused weakness in both lateral rotation and the initial 15 to 20 degrees of abduction of the arm. Which nerve was most probably injured?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Lower subscapular", "Axillary", "Radial"],
    correctAnswer: "Suprascapular",
    explanation:
      "The supraspinatus is innervated by the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6) and the nerve continues through the spinoglenoid notch and innervates the infraspinatus. The supraspinatus initiates abduction of the arm up to the first 15 to 20 degrees. The subscapular nerve supplies the subscapularis and teres major muscles, which are medial rotators of the arm. The axillary nerve supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles and also a patch of skin on the lateral side of the shoulder. The deltoid abducts the arm beyond 20 degrees, and the teres minor muscle, although a lateral rotator, does not abduct the arm. The radial nerve supplies muscles in the posterior compartments of the arm and forearm, which are extensors of the elbow, wrist, and fingers in that order. The upper subscapular nerve supplies the subscapularis, a medial rotator of the arm.",

    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Joint capsule",
      "Interosseous membrane",
      "Radial collateral",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Anular",
    explanation:
      "“Nursemaid’s elbow,” a condition commonly found in children below 5 years of age, is caused by a sharp pull of the child’s hand. In children, the anular ligament, which holds the head of the radius in place, is lax and allows the radial head to sublux when the hand is pulled. Also the radial head is small, so the anular ligament does not have a good “grip” on the hand. The joint capsule of the radioulnar joint is not attached to the radius; rather it passes around the neck of the radius inferiorly to attach to the coronoid process of the ulna. The interosseous membrane binds the radius and ulna together and does not maintain stability of the joint. The radial collateral ligament attaches the lateral side of the head of the radius to the lateral condyle of the humerus. The ulnar collateral ligament attaches the medial side of the ulnar head to the medial condyle of the humerus.",

    correctAnswer: "Numbness and weakness of the little and ring fingers",
    explanation:
      "The patient has a classic claw hand due to the damage of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve by the fractured hamate at Guyon’s canal. This nerve supplies the intrinsic muscles of the hand except the lateral two lumbricals and the thenar muscles. This nerve also supplies cutaneous innervations to the medial one and a half fingers (ring and little fingers) in the palmar and dorsal sides. The lumbricals and interossei insert at the back of the fingers via the dorsal (extensor) hood. This hood extends from the metacarpophalangeal joint to the distal phalanx. Through this mechanism, the muscles flex the metacarpophalangeal joint and extend the interphalangeal joint. With damage to the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, this function is lost. The result is that there will be flexion of the interphalangeal joints and extension of the metacarpophalangeal joint, giving the appearance as shown in the photograph.",

In this case the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus is being compressed by a cervical rib. The anterior division of the inferior trunk continues as the medial cord of the brachial plexus. The medial brachial cutaneous nerve (medial cutaneous nerve of the arm) and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm) are branches of the medial cord of the plexus, with the ulnar nerve as its terminal branch.

    correctAnswer: "Tenovaginitis stenosans (trigger finger)",
    explanation:
      "Tenovaginitis stenosans occurs after swelling or nodular growth of the flexor tendon, which interferes with it gliding through the pulley and producing a snap or click on active extension or flexion. Mallet finger presents with permanent flexion of the distal phalanx from the lateral band of the extensor digitorum avulsion. Boutonnière deformity is due to avulsion of the central band of the extensor digitorum tendon, which presents as abnormal flexion of the middle phalanx and hyperextension of the distal phalanx. Boxer’s fracture affects the metacarpals of the second and third digits commonly. Dupuytren’s contracture is progressive fibrosis of the palmar aponeurosis and fascia leading to progressive shortening and thickening, eventually leading to permanent partial flexion of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.",

Hook of hamate compressing the ulnar artery is also incorrect.

      "In the midshaft region of the humerus the radial nerve runs in the radial groove; fracture of the humerus at this point will likely impinge directly on the radial nerve, producing a sensory deficit along the posterior aspect of the forearm. The lateral aspect of the forearm is innervated by the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve of the forearm, which comes from the musculocutaneous nerve. These nerves may not be affected by a midshaft fracture of the humerus because they are well separated from the bone by muscle. The medial aspect of the arm and forearm is supplied by the intercostobrachial nerve and the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve that takes its origin from the medial cord of the brachial plexus where it runs superficially, making it extremely difficult to injure both nerves during a midshaft fracture of the humerus.

      "The acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are critical to the stability of the shoulder. In particular, the coracoclavicular ligament provides much of the weight-bearing support for the upper limb on the clavicle. The acromioclavicular joint ligament attaches the acromion (of the scapula) to the clavicle and the coracoclavicular ligament attaches the coracoid process to the clavicle.

    explanation:
      "The radiograph shows a fracture of the humerus at the surgical neck. The bruising and dimpling of the upper arm would result from this injury. The axillary nerve leaves the brachial plexus as a terminal branch of the posterior cord. It passes through the quadrangular space and wraps around the head of the humerus on its way to provide innervation to the teres minor, the deltoid, and the portion of skin over the lower aspect of the deltoid that is known as the “sergeant’s patch.” The radial nerve travels in the radial groove along the shaft of the humerus and would be injured in a fracture of the shaft of the humerus. The ulnar nerve would be injured in a fracture of the medial epicondyle. The median nerve travels too deep to be injured here and could be compressed at the carpal tunnel or at the cubital fossa. The musculocutaneous nerve is likewise within the tissue and will not be affected by this injury.",

    question:
      "A 14-year-old boy falls on his outstretched hand. Examination reveals point tenderness above the humeral epicondyles and a pulsatile mass just above the cubital fossa. Neurological examination of the upper limb reveals weakness of pronation, wrist flexion, and grip strength. Only flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers is intact. Thumb flexion and opposition are also impaired. A radiograph reveals a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Which structures injured by the fracture best account for the findings?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery",
      "Radial nerve and deep brachial artery",
      "Ulnar nerve and ulnar artery",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Median nerve and brachial artery",
    explanation:
      "The median nerve and brachial artery were injured. Injury to the median nerve is indicated by the weakness of pronation, wrist flexion, and grip strength. The median nerve innervates the muscles that govern or carry out these movements. The brachial artery is near the median nerve and can also be injured. Flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers indicates that the ulnar nerve is intact. The radiograph indicates a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, which is the region in which the median nerve passes. A fracture at the surgical neck would injure the axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery. A fracture of the shaft of the humerus would injure the radial nerve and deep brachial artery. The superficial radial nerve and artery would be damaged by injury over or in the anatomical snuffbox.",
