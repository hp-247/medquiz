    question:
      "A 45-year-old man complains of low back pain that radiates into both lower limbs and leg weakness. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan reveals that the body of the L5 vertebra is displaced anteriorly. A diagnosis of the patient's condition would be:",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Spinal stenosis", "Spondylolysis", "Spondylitis"],
    correctAnswer: "Spondylolisthesis",
    explanation:
      "In spondylolisthesis, there is an anterior displacement of vertebral body relative to the vertebral body inferior to it. Spondylolisthesis is usually accompanied by a defect or fracture of the isthmus of that vertebra. Spondylolisthesis is most common between the L5 vertebra and the sacrum and, in this patient, has stretched roots of lumbosacral spinal nerves in the cauda equina. This results in lower back pain radiating into both lower limbs and weaknesses in muscles of the legs.",

    question:
      "A spinal anesthesia is used for a patient undergoing surgery. The needle is passed between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Which of the following structures will not be traversed by the needle in a normal performance of the procedure?",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Interspinous ligament", "Epidural space", "Dura"],
    correctAnswer: "Posterior longitudinal ligament",
    explanation:
      "The posterior longitudinal ligament covers the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and the intervening disks and is anterior to the dural sac; the needle pieces the posterior aspect of the sac in a normal performance of a spinal procedure.",

    question:
      "A spinal anesthesia is used for a patient undergoing surgery. The needle is passed between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Which of the following structures in the vettebral canal will be anesthetized in a spinal procedure?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Dorsal and ventral rami",
      "Lumbar spinal nerves",
      "Lumbrosacral plexus",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Dorsal and ventral roots",
    explanation:
      "The dorsal and ventral roots are in cauda equina, found in the vertebral canal; the other choices are found either in the intevertebral foramen or outside the vertebral canal.",

    question:
      "An MRI reveals that a patient has a posterolateral herniation of the nucleus pulposus of the intevertebral disk between L5 and the sacrum. which of the following might you expect to observe in the patient?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Weakness in dorsiflexion",
      "Altered sensation on the dorsum of the foot",
      "Weakness in extension of the leg at the knee",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Weakness in plantar flexion",
    explanation:
      "The roots of the S1 spinal nerve are typically compressed by a posterolateral herniation of the disk between L5 and S1. Compression of the S1 roots may result in altered sensation in the posterolateral leg, heal, and lateral side of the foot, weakness in flexion of the leg at the knee, and weakness in plantar flexion.",

    question:
      "A 50-year old man complains of back pain and has difficulty walking. Diagnostic imaging reveals calcification of the sacroiliac joints and anterior longitudnial ligament resulting from additional bone growth by osteophytes. These findings suggest that the patient has",
    incorrectAnswers: ["Scoliosis", "Spinal stenosis", "Spondylosis."],
    correctAnswer: "Spondylitis",
    explanation:
      "In spondylitis, additional bone growth by osteophytes at the margins of the vertebral bodies may result in calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and the sacroiliac joints.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A 64-year-old man presents with pain that radiates from the back, throug the posterior thigh, and into the leg and foot. The diagnosis is a herniated nucleus pulposus of the intervettebral disk between the L4 and the L5 vertebrae. What else might the patient experience?",
    incorrectAnswers: [
      "Altered sensation in the L3 dermatome",
      "Fecal incontinence",
      "Weakness in the ability to extend the leg at the knee",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Weakness of muscles innervated by the L5 spinal cord segment",
    explanation:
      "The L5 spinal nerve has been compressed. All other choices reflect lesions to spinal nerves other than L5.",
